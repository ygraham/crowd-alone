A republican strategy to hinder the reelection of Obama
The republican leaders justified their politics by the need to fight against the electoral fraud.
Now well, the Central Brennan considers this last a myth and affirms that the electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States that the number of people that die on account of the fall of a ray.
In fact, the republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
A thing is certain: those new dispositions will affect negatively to the rate of participation.
In that sense, these measures will mine in part the American democratic system.
Contrary to what occurs in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line a majority of the American governments they promulgated, from 2009, new laws that complicated the process of inscription or of voting.
This phenomenon has extended after the elections of November of 2010, that saw the increase of 675 new republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, during the year 2011 180 government bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right of vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require that the voters feel a document of identity with a photography, besides a test of American citizenship.
On the other hand, those laws reduce the periods of vote anticipated, they nullify the right to be recorded as the voter in the day of the scrutiny and they withdraw their right to the vote to the citizens with penal antecedents.
Before the elections of 2006, no American state required that the voters presented a document of identity with photography.
The State of Indiana was the first one in requiring it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
Because of it, the republican authorities were hurried to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported government bills in 34 states to force the voters to present a document of identity with photography.
Is important to keep in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, the American citizens do not have a document of universal identity, like the card of the Social Security.
In fact, a 11% of the American citizens, that is to say, 21 million people in age to vote, they include no document of identity with photography emitted by a governmental agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million of new voters in 2012 lack a document of identity with those characteristics.
But, often, the obtaining of the slope required identity document more than a hundred dollars.
With which, the new restrictions affect in a disproportionate way the youths, the minorities and the people with low incomes.
In fact, a 25% of Afro-American, a 15% of people that win less than 35,000 dollars to the year, a 18% of the citizens of more than 65 years and a 20% of the voters from among 18 and 29 years do not include a document of identity with photography.
And still there is more.
In many states the students, the voters that more vote the democratic candidates, they cannot utilize the document of identity with photography emitted by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize the members of the clubs of fishing or hunting that are used to voting to the republican parties to utilize the documents emitted by you said clubs.
Before 2004 no state required the test of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state in presenting happiness demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states has adopted laws that require that the voters show that are American citizens.
Those measures seek, clearly, to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems to be that two of each three Hispanic voters support to the democratic party.
On the other hand, the republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that revoked the inscription of voters the same day of the scrutiny in eight states.
Besides, they limited the right of the people and the groups to create a service of aid to the voters that wanted to be recorded.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the general elections of 2004, the campaigns of inscription of the voters contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 achieved that the of new voters inscription rate to fall in 2010 in comparison with the year 2006.
Besides, the republican legislators adopted laws in other five states that favored the reduction of the period of vote in advance.
For example, in the elections of 2008 in Florida, a 33% of the voters that voted in advance they were Afro-American, while these last did not represent more than a 13% of the voters of the state.
In the case of the Hispanic the same thing occurred exactly.
These do not they represent more than a 11% of the voters, what equals to a 24% of the citizens that vote in advance.
Nevertheless, the white, that represent a 76% of the electorate, they do not represent more than the 46% of the citizens that vote in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have opposed fervently to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
In this sense, the democratic governors have blocked various government bills.
The Attorney General's Office of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was able, in part, to limit the damages.
For example, only 16 of 34 states they adopted the law that required the presentation of a document of identity with photography.
Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have voted itself, since is of course with them intends to influence in the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report of the Central one Brennan of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted happinesses laws represent 171 of the 270 necessary votes in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too soon to affirm with certainty if these legislative modifications to scale of electoral system will have a significant impact in the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
A thing is certain: those new dispositions will affect negatively to the rate of participation.
In this sense, the measures will mine in part the American democratic system.
Detection of the cancer of prostate: Be done the test or not to do it to him?
In fact, the test of PSA presents, from time to time, erroneous results, with false negative or even false results positive results, after the ones that is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
It is a more than sufficient motive to cause to doubt the men, already reluctant in and of itself, on if they should be done or not the tests of detection.
Be done the test or not?
We have asked counsel to two specialists.
In the studies carried out in the United States a great index of contagions among the groups of sample was detected, for which is difficult to interpret those data and to do firm recommendations.
In turn, the European study showed certain difference of mortality among the patients that had been carried out the detection and the ones that not.
The study, with a monitoring at the age of 12, showed besides that exists between the 30 and the 40% of possibilities to suffer metastasis if itself not the test of detection has been carried out.
Bearing a grudge, therefore, the test from the 50 years, or from the 40 years if your father has suffered cancer of prostate.
The men of Afro-American origin have a higher index of risk.
The key is to take a good decision once detected the cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to achieve that the patient understand the degree of risk of its cancer. They should be offered him all the possible options and not necessarily to treat the cancers of prostate that done not attempt against the long-term life, in whose case should opt more either for an active caution of the illness.
Nowadays many men to the ones that has been detected them a cancer are not treaties, since said cancer is not aggressive neither entrails a risk for its life.
In its place, we suggest them an active caution of the illness and, if this progresses, we offer them a processing.
We determine each time with more frequency precise criteria to decide who would owe or not to be tried.
Bearing a grudge that the test in any case be done.
But it is important that speak with its doctor to determine if should be done the test or not.
Movember has created, in contribution with the International Company of Urology, a tool that permits to evaluate the pros and the contras of the test of PSA.
This document can be dischargeed (for the moment alone in English, but translations will be offered before long) in the following direction: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Preventing the illness
Unfortunately, not a miraculous prescription exists to prevent the cancer.
In spite of the progresses of the investigations, the healthy life habits adoption they continue being the best way of reducing the risks of suffering the illness.
We reckon that if everyone to eat well and themselves to move the sufficient thing, they would be able to prevent a 30% of the cancers.
"If nobody smoked, that rate would be elevated, at least, to the 50%", underlines André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Company against the Cancer.
On the other hand, we evaluate that around the 10% of the cancers they are hereditary.
Many other they continue being completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Company against the Cancer, the fight against the smoking continues being a priority in spite of the decrease of the number of smokers.
The tobacco is linked with the 85% of the cases of the lung cancer.
It constitutes, besides, a factor of risk for other types of cancers.
It damages enormously the health of the people.
"Today for the present, still there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", declared the spokesman André Beaulieu.
An encouraging data: 10 years after stop smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced halfway.
The weight
The fatness and the obesity favor also the apparition of the illness, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast cancer, of colon and of straight, of esophagus, of pancreas and of uterus.
"The investigations show that the practice to regulate of physical activity during all the life protects against the breast cancer", they add.
The diet
The agency recommends, likewise, to limit the consumption of red meats.
In large quantities, they cause scale the risks to suffer a cancer colorrectal.
The products of cooked pork should also be avoided.
The conservation of the meat for its smoked, dried or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the agency and to carry to the development of the cancer", they explain us.
The vitamins
In recent years, various scientists have studied the links between the vitamin complexes and the cancer.
Nevertheless, for the moment its investigations are not conclusive.
Segú the SCC, the studies about the vitamin AND they are contradictory.
While in one of them a decrease of the prostate cancer risks was verified, in another what was observed was, more well, an increase.
The effect of the vitamin D in the cancer has neither been able to be determined with clarity.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance to speak on the anxieties and the family antecedents of each one with its doctor.
"To do the test of detection does not cause cancer."
The bosón of Higgs in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the bosón of Higgs generated a great commotion last summer, and with reason.
He is believed, in fact, that this bosón is a participant of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, is a matter of the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: ours better or "less bad" explanation of the nature and of the behavior of the matter, that not yet has been observed empirical.
But for the physicists is not completely of course be a matter of Higgs.
We know without place to doubts that a new particle exists and that a striking resemblance to the bosón of Higgs bears predicted by the standard model.
Besides, new alert data this week in an important congress of physics celebrated in Kyoto seem to confirm that yes is it, although still lack more data to be completely sure.
Of all ways, we suppose that is a matter of Higgs, since the possibilities to be mistaken seem few. We will see of what treats.
There is, in this great world, a law generalized and inescapable that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is not way to infringe that norm and him not too much he try, because he will finish being done damage.
Although the physics of the particles be a very complex world, has been shown that also in her a law of these characteristics exists: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, that stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same one "been quantum"; a "been" that is evident, broadly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles in two categories.
By a part we find us with the good called citizens fermiones, that obey wisely at the beginning of Pauli.
And by another they are the bosones, a dirty panda of anarchists that considers respect nothing, or at least not by this principle, what signifies that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the web page The Particle Adventure of the Laboratories Berkeley that, certainly, is extraordinary, the bosones are divided into two groups: the inns, of the ones that we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by the ones that the large forces of the nature spread and with which the bosón of Higgs would be of related any way.
These bosones, goatish to underline here, are not the exotic bugs that would be able to believe.
In fact, if manages to read this chronicle, is thanks to a bosón extraordinarily banal: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes of direction, "upsets" the electromagnetic field in that I need environment; a little as when we launch a stone to a reservoir.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of the light, of the infrared, of the ultravioletas, etc.), and this wave is not another thing that a photon; that is to say, one of the bosones "bearers of force".
More stable field
The same thing with the bosón occurs of Higgs, with the difference that is a matter of another field, the field of Higgs, that needs to be "disorderly" so that this bosón appear.
Now well, the field of Higgs is a lot more stable than the electromagnetic field. Activate it does lack to arrive at extremely high energies, a little as if was a matter of a reservoir ice cream in which only a rock gross could be slid for the surface.
Because of it it causes lacks an immense particle accelerator as that of the CERN (¡the great colisionador of hadrons is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to reach such levels of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relation between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all the particles neither all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, they do it, but other not: a piece of role, for example, will not be maintained never by itself hit at the door of a refrigerator.
And of the same form, not all the particles interact with the field of Higgs: the ones that cause they have it a mass, while the remainder (how the photon, certainly), do not they have it.
Now well, ¿what "they can contribute" all those investigations?, question the Lady Plamondon.
For the science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and permits, besides, that the physical escrutinen the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
In turn, many desire fervently that be found, therefore the smaller difference would be able to open a door to a "new physical" that cover certain holes of the model.
This, one must tell it, has still enormous lacks, since does not propose any explanation relating to the gravity (¡UPS!) or to the dark matter, that conforms around the 80% of the matter of the Universe (¡another UPS!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN up to now.
Repercussions
The repercussions of said investigations in our day by day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we mistake us saying that will not have none.
So that they see: at the beginning of the years 60, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their works would cause.
They made out the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as already the physical one he said Willard Boyle, that worked in the laboratories Bell, where the laser in 1960 was invented, and that devised the first continuous laser (the first were pressed) in 1962, at the beginning the laser more well was considered an "apparatus of laboratory".
Imagine...
And besides, the applications can also proceed of all the orchestration that surrounds to the investigation.
For example, the same one Willard Boyle devised a sensor of light in 1969 in the course of its investigation in matter of viewpoints.
In spite of the fact that was not at all his original intention, this sensor serves now of "eye" for all the digital apparatuses of the world, what the Nobel of physics in 2009 was worth him.
That does not it mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC quieran necessarily to transform our lives, but never is known...
Cared for mitigating. The best form to die... | Him Devoir
In its Commission to Die in dignity, Quebec debated recently the delicate question of the end of the life.
The debate should be taken up again quick while is prepared a government bill.
Now well, inside that essential control, still there is a lot that to do.
Him Devoir has tried to see it closely.
Barely some weeks ago, the Mr. L. he lived alone in his apartment of the Montérégie.
The cancer of prostate that him was destroying him had given an I breathe of two years.
"Five years of life had given me, but already I carry thus seven", relates, fact a passes, fallen in its bed in the center of mitigating cares Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which the previous day arrived.
"But always it is a shock, we cannot be prepared for this", continues.
The illness has caused havoc: an enormous weakness that impedes to go alone to the bath and even to eat in and of itself.
Seated set against a tempting lunch, accepts resigned that they help him to eat.
Brave, it arrives even to smile, to speak with the strangers that attentions dedicate him, medicines bring him and they offer him a bath.
The bravery of the ordinary death.
"My greater desire is that they cure me the diarrhea, is humiliating", confesses.
Some hours later, the team found remedy to that badly.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man does pis standing", he relates Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the central one Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to its infancy, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the capacity of the person to accept that decline", verifies.
Because, according to the opinion of the majority of the people that work in mitigating cares, the large moments take place in the same heart of that decline.
All the patients that enter the center of mitigating cares Victor-Gadbois suffer cancer.
They have a forecast of maximum life of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses that surround them no longer they offer the cares "curative".
The major fear of the Mrs. A., of 89 years, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the illness has done to discover its children.
"I have some good children", adds.
"No longer desires in this life remain me more", he says, before accepting that him he be placed a mask to help to breathe.
And wait, in the next days, a last visit of its son that lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and aid to the diet.
They are mitigating cares that them they are given when itself nothing can be done more.
To help that its death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we include a bed of mitigating cares for each 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that all we will finish dying some day.
Here, the life continues in the better possible conditions, explains the Dra. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether to physical, emotional or spiritual level of comfort.
To the dying man they are offered rinse him of mouth with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
To the diabetic no longer it is controlled them its rate of sugar.
The death forms part of the routine thing.
Yesterday at night we serve a beer to the Mr. X, that died in the course at night.
This morning, its son was finished the beer to the feet of the deceased.
"We help so much the patients as to its beloved beings", relates Nathalie Savard, director of the cares.
In the central one Victor-Gadbois the days elapse without being never equal.
Next to a man of 94 years that savors his last family meeting in the patio, well placed among his pillows while all they drink to his health, a youth of 36 years dies of tragic form, surrounded by his parents, his woman and his two children, after to have tried all to survive.
"Since six months ago, always there are from three to five busy beds by people less than 45 sick years of cancer", itself restless the Dra. Christiane Martel.
A 53% of the patients that are admitted in the central Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from its house and a 47% of the hospital.
Problem of the access to mitigating cares
A 77% of the Canadians simply does not have access to the mitigating cares, that is to say, to the cares conceived to alleviate the suffering when a sick one arrives at the phase terminal of its life, be in its residence, in the hospital or in a center of cares.
And various agencies, as the central one Victor-Gadbois and the company of mitigating cares to residence of the Grand Montréal, they specialize themselves almost exclusively in the care of the patients with cancer.
It is exactly that great relative lack in the sanitary cares of Quebec what does that many doctors specialized in mitigating cares fear the adoption of a law that to regulate the euthanasia and the suicide attended.
Since the month of October, a manifesto signed by eminences of the mitigating cares, like the Dr. Balfour Mount and the Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show its opposition to such initiative.
According to the Dra. Christiane Martel, the sanitary system of Quebec is not it sufficient competent as to assure that any have the right to mitigating cares of quality before be accepted to proceed with the euthanasia.
"Recently", it relates, "I have seen a patient to pass 14 days in large ER suffering pains without itself have done the necessary thing to alleviate it.
I am afraid that the patients desire to die alone because they do not receive the adequate cares".
And in parallel, many oncologists persist with their patients to the last day, in spite of the worst forecasts.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already low minimums when left a processing of exhausting chemotherapy.
"When I told him my oncologist that wanted to stop the processing, she told me that a lot of grief he gave him that wanted to stop fighting", he relates.
"Nevertheless, ¡she had said me that there was not nothing but to do!"
There is not omnipotent cares
The Dra. Martel believes that a 90% of the sick that request to die they thank its attendants that them have not attended in its demands once has been alleviated them its pain thanks to a team of mitigating cares.
But one must say that the mitigating cares are not absolutely omnipotent as for the processing of the pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the mitigating cares to residence of Grand Montréal, the patients do not respond to the processing against the pain in a 8% of the cases.
In the end of the life, the doctors are used to resorting to the mitigating sedation, that serves to sleep to the patient up to now of its death, whether of sporadic form or of permanent form.
We cannot pretend that do not we understand that part of the suffering.
Each time more, the illness done not alleviate is going to have the possibility to have that mitigating sedation.
The sick that are not alleviated say all the same thing: "I want to die".
But that does not it mean necessarily "I want the euthanasia", but "I want that they alleviate me".
The execution of this report has been possible thanks to a scholarship of journalism of the health investigation institutes of Canada.
Real estate scandals of great amplitude in Quebec
Officials of the road network, businessmen of the BTP, political parties funds collectors and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day after day, what know about a formidable one "system", of the one that they form part the industry of the construction, officials, political, union and mafia.
An "industry" that left too expensive to the contributing quebequenses, above all in the years 1990 and 2000.
"The system turns out to be curious how is pulverized once we have hunted to the large media", ridicules Jacques Duchesneau, representative in Quebec and old leader of the Police of Montreal.
He headed the crash of the scandal in 2011, that was possible thanks to an investigation in depth on the embezzlements connected with contracts of highways in Quebec, that the liberal prime minister of that moment, Jean Charest, he had not consented more than in delaying.
The "report Duchesneau" established a direct link among the industry, the secret financing of the parties and the corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the department of transportations would have been saved thousand million dollars in contracts", containing some of its instincts of being remained with a proportional part.
The Commission Charbonneau "already has done to fall to two mayors", adds, while expects to be able to arrive at "to show the existing stratagems behind the individuals".
A unit permanent anticorruption, created in 2011
The Unit permanent anticorruption, created in 2011, applies also with its team of administrators, investigators and analysts of the government.
This unit functions besides the police officers of "the squad Marteau", that, since 2009, they have done that the "cartel of the sewer system" of Montreal be moderated at the moment of to inflate contracts.
These last weeks, the unit has proceeded to the registration in series of the accusations by fraud and corruption against municipal charges as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city of the outskirts.
The next one of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, that has just resigned of its position of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that has been pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
It has accused formally engineers of the road network of Montreal and to businessmen of Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Linen Zambito.
This last one has caused commotion upon explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining of public contracts.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary connected with the mafia that transfered the money to Union Montréal, the party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Spidermonkey distributed money to dexterous and sinister during the years 2000, offering more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (some 68,000 euro) to provincial parties, above all to the liberals in the power.
It admitted, likewise, to have organized a collection of illegal funds for the former-viceprimera liberal minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the price of the contracts of sewer system
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption functioned with efficacy.
Gilles Surprenant, exingeniero of public works, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years received gifts, invitations to trips, tournaments of golf, restaurants, parties of hockey and bribes of businesses of the sector of the construction by a total of 736,000 dollars, all it in exchange for contracts of whose sewer system cost inflated.
Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money by inflating the bills between a 30% and a 40% in concept of false extras.
Besides, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, he accused M. Tremblay in fact the blind eye deliberately to a parallel budget and he filled his chests of dirty money.
Because of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November and carried to Montreal to an enormous crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first chosen politics of Montreal that caused sounded the alarm.
As the mayor of the district of Rivière-give-Prairies, in the east of the island, was opposed since 2010 for sale of a municipal land acquired by 5 million dollars and resold by 1.6 million to the developers in full real estate boom.
The 70% of the money of the electoral campaigns was dirty money
Of the investigation that finally he will be carry out, she assures that he throws "of a thread to be able to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, for stop the gangrene and to fish to the guilty".
And it adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning the injuries but would cause lacks a unit of clean investigation in Montreal and to be very alerts so that the doubtful practices be not repeated.
How do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, in turn, declares that "the officials have stolen hundreds of million dollars", but is restless above all by the role of the '"political chosen current of the stratagem".
Reckoning in a 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ridicules: "They have said me that that is not more than a pale reflection of the reality".
The government quebequés proposes to limit to 100 dollars the donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while not the electoral expenses be limited strictly, there will be dirty money in the politics".
Preconiza a complete review of the public contracts granting system and of financing of the parties: "We cannot fall lower; to go to the fund of the things, with bravery, will permit us to reconstruct the house with some more solid bases, with more controls and laws".
If this history blurs the international image of Quebec and of Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites to those that laugh to be looked at to the mirror.
"¡The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new company with the PSG.
How would it explain that advance?
It would be able to explain for a takes of individual conscience, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Large players have arrived.
I advance during the day in day to its side.
The technical personnel has also contributed me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to elevate the level of my play.
In a party, that is easier.
All goes very fast in the soccer.
But I do not get hot myself.
Since my beginnings in the center of preformación of INF Clairefontaine to my step by Saint-Etienne, always I have advanced by leaps and bounds.
It is going to obtain benefit of the competence recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
Them they recruited of this summer they are usual to dispute parties of very high level.
They know that each training is crucial.
That does that a player as I want to fight and to give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti contributes me a lot as for my positioning.
It is supported by enclosed as Claude Makelele, that played in the same position that I.
Ancelotti is the man that needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all the technicians.
Today for the present, there is not nobody equal in the League 1 and is among the better European coaches.
Has a great experience and has earned numerous titles with the better clubs.
Has worked with large players.
I believe that will be carried other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just left the series of wounds.
The confidence that has in me explains also my good performance.
What thinks on the PSG in the first part of the season?
In the League 1, Lyon has removed us the position of leader.
But we continue in the ambush.
One of our greater objectives is the League of champions: we have classified us for the quarterfinals with style.
Which is the objective of the club in this competition?
We are going to treat to arrive as far away as possible.
From now on, can pass any thing.
But we have a lot that to say set against many and very good European teams.
We want, to begin, to finish the first of our league set against the Oporto for be able to receive the return of quarterfinals.
The PSG can be becomes a great club European short-term?
Already has the budget...
Be become a great club European, Paris has to win titles and to be there long-term.
Today for the present, that is not the case.
To economic level, the PSG is delivered to its media so that that project be summarized.
Win not the cup in the League 1, as in the last season, ¿would constitute a great failure?
Of course, would be a great deception.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in carrying us that title of champions.
In the last season we do not arrive far away.
In May we carry us a deception, since we included the optimum conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finish with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a quite better season.
This year I believe that will be the good one.
Even if the large teams as the Marseilles, the Lyon and the Burgundy fight for the title, I believe that we include the weapons for llevárnoslo.
He believes that the media expect more than the PSG?
It is normal that expect a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players that we have.
We have accepted it completely.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, that still they be found with things that to reproach us is a little frustrating.
We ask us what more expects the people.
Never we will be able to win 4-0 all weekends.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to set in motion a project of play.
A team is built with time.
In the League of champions we have shown that we can respond and been present.
Look at to the Manchester City that, after two seasons, has failed to classify for quarterfinals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect our adversaries and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseilles, that were not well the previous season, they have been seen "prompted" by this new one PSG.
That shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I expect that in May we can say with a smile that, in spite of all the difficulties, we have finished carrying us the trophy.
The PSG seems completely clerk of the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better than we say that we have a "Zlatandependencia".
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that puts many goals.
It has come to show that is the star of the League 1.
And it has shown in all the teams by the ones that has passed that is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and to the player.
And he also respects the men that has around him.
What has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes to the others to enlarge its level of play.
Thiago Forest, one of the better defenders of the world, permits also that all we progress.
How have you lived the Eurocopa 2012 with the team of France?
Has been a deception.
Was very enthusiastic by participating in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my wound impeded me to accumulate time of play.
I saw things there and I left reinforced.
Today achievement to play good parties in the selection.
It is what expected since my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and to it is owed that today we have an exemplary behavior.
What vision you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the front of the "bleus"?
It is obtaining results.
They are well situated in the group of classification for the World one.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and he inspires to win.
As was the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to do comparisons.
Blanc achieved its objective to classify us for the Eurocopa.
I expect that Didier Deschamps carry to the selection to Brazil.
The tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain served to sit down the bases?
That play gave us confidence.
Each one fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, not a play seemed in all my had lived career.
With Bitcoin, to pay and to sell without banks
Just the opposite to the current monetary exchanges, based on the central banks, the identifying transactions and the loads of prosecution among the parts.
Besides, as often it occurs in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the composed, current monetary system of banking monopolies, carries to the financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudónimo), is at the same time a convertible virtual currency to dollars, euro, etc. and a protocol of sure change to the way of BitTorrent, that permits the equal card indexes exchange to equal.
They have been registered near 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers of the network.
And near some thousand websites they accept the bitcoins as donations or as a way of payment.
The quotation of the bitcoin, after to have arrived at the top of 30 dollars (23 euro) in June of 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to patrol the ten dollars (the quotations are counted in the page bitcoincharts.com).
It is nothing impressive if we compare him with the world changes in real currency or in financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested for him in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described like "the virtual currency with more success", "that competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differentiates themselves of other systems with types of virtual currencies as the "credits", utilized to advance in a videogame and that can be won playing or they can be bought (and even from time to time to trade).
The network social Facebook developed also this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With the bitcoin, all the nodes of network are at the same time depository of account books, checking, transmitters of currency and buyers and salespersons.
How that network functions?
Each transaction between two users is done in reality between two electronic directions in the shape of e-mail.
A user can elect a different direction for each payment, guaranteeing thus the anonymity.
An assembly of informations connected with this transaction signs electronically through a system of coded to double key.
The network thus can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the card index, is also possible to assure that the changes of bitcoins be evident in the public account book, that is diffused for all the network.
The key milestone consists of writing that new transaction in that book.
This it passes for the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers and the winner, a species of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add that complementary line.
It is a matter of a phase of cut of card index, that is to say, of transformation of a great card index in a numerical track more cuts and unique.
The computers "catch" the new transaction and they add a number before "to cut" the assembly.
The objective is to find the number that offer a private track (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes verify easily that is the good one.
The transaction is found then indestructibly connected with the overall chain of the other transactions; every modification would change the track.
If, to commit a fraud, a user he wanted to pay two times with the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the network only would accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphan, since both have different tracks.
The computer that resolve the challenge is carried 50 bitcoins.
To avoid the inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the cienmillonésimo, what leaves an extensive margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is revealed also in each increase of the power of calculation.
The life of the network has already its ups and downs.
The websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and they have been stolen bitcoins in deposit.
"The failure utilized does not affect to the same protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, that has just launched Paymium, a business of payment in real currency that utilizes the network Bitcoin.
The ECB keeps in mind besides the possibilities of blanquo of money thanks to this anonymous service.
But the cash presents the same defect.
The actors of weight as Wikipedia reject the payments of this type.
Other, like the platform Wordpress, they accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, they analyzed the account book and they showed that near the 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.
In November they were launched the "gigantic discounts".
"They changed 30,000 dollars", is delightd Jon Holmquist, that works for Coinabul, that converts the bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, he believes enough in the potential of this technology besides of in the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, equals to a credit card (in real currency) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but utilizes Bitcoin to validate the transactions, that thus leave cheaper.
The bearer, besides, negotiates its identity and is able, therefore, to remain in the anonymity.
The system is easy to set in motion in the commerce, that have not to install new terminals neither software.
It suffices them with supplying a direction that a telephone be able "to photograph and to recognize", I need Pierre Noizat, that assures to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of review of the hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will cause lacks a time so that Bitcoin be imposed, but in 2013 would be able there to be a change", predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB foresees to revalue the high today respected, diverse risks, in the event that this currency be successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And later?
The French troops abandoned their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the Americans should leave at the end of 2014.
It is hour that the Afghan army take up again possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without expecting nothing of us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, to the ones that we have considered terrorist.
And to ourselves, with ours 88 soldiers murdered, more the injured and them mutilated.
The Talibans include old and foreign extremists leaders refugees in Pakistan, but often also with peasants that reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if to their causes they unite the yihadistas, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the uzbecos or the tayikos.
They tolerated, at times even helped by the local rebels, these no longer will be it when the westerners be done more discreet.
The departure of the French troops of the base of Nijrab, that I observed since the high thing of the hills planted of almond trees thanks to the French credits, was done for order.
The convoys of trucks and of tanks returned to Kabul without suffering no attack, watched by the helicopters.
There will not be affluence of Talibans in Kabul from ends of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood on account of the fights among different factions.
Its it takes of control of the country had been perceived as a species of liberation, the return to the security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of its peasants surpassed by the organization Al-qaeda, but its situation is not better today.
The old muyahidines, the current government and the current Talibans share the desire to maintain to the women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the war antisoviética returned to the power in 2001.
They have become speculators, being done with governmental lands to resell them as solar for the refugees that have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting the pair of enormous American contracts of subcontracting.
They are discredited; the majority of them they have not fought.
The people, I have heard in the country, aspires to a government that be not formed by thieves.
Many youths want to be gone, as also itself Iran the ones that have known to be take advantage of the American generosity: the leak of capital is considerable.
The youths are tired of the war and of their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and they have appreciated their advantages.
With around a 65% of its population less than 25 years, Kabul counts right now with 5 million inhabitants, a fifth part of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full so much of girls as of children.
There it will be that to give work to those youths that will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties neither to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, included the armed opposition, they are avid of mobile telephones. The television and its Turkish melodramas that present a modern world has large admirers in all the country.
The army is now present.
Legitimate the authorities will be considered that want to direct the country?
The old commanders of the fight antisoviética worry already to reconstruct the provincial militias, that will flee the central government.
Afghanistan, country of mountains, of hardly local identities, would should to be able to be benefited of a certain decentralization to image of the western nations. Nevertheless, the United States have wanted it to transform into a state centralized, with a power presidential fort, suppressing the position of the prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
The president Karzai does not want the foreign control, particularly because of the elections predicted in April of 2014.
Nevertheless, its country depends on the foreign aid since the years 50 and even before.
Any industry there is reestablecido their services, themselves no reservoir has been fixed neither the systems of important irrigation have been repaired.
All is imported and itself nothing except fruits is produced and vegetables.
The priority is left the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, would have been necessary the governmental control.
The rumor was expanded that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that did not it do more than enlarging the feeling that the westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the iron ores or of copper of the land and without media of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is not mine.
The Chinese already almost have abandoned the Month copper mines Aynak, leaving that the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excavate the immense court summons búdico and they remain there as the most important employers of the province.
It will do also lacks that Afghanistan and Pakistan, country of the one that the importings depend extensively and the exports, they re-establish their normal relations.
The French troops left November 20.
The new one tried cooperation foresees the continuation of the traditional aids: schools of girls, schools of children, a department of French in the university, the French Institute, the cooperation in the agricultural, sanitary, legal, and military environments and the support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the purpose to try "to be won the hearts and the spirits" and to carry out the impossible task to do that the aid and the offensive actions coincide, a service of "military and civil actions" of the Department of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and caused brought through a small NGO French numerous works of collective interest and actions of agricultural rehabilitation in scores of localities of mountain.
Those works, fond of sweets to obtain local labor, they have been able to help to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit-bearing trees, solar protection and cultivation surfaces increase.
What will we leave as memory after two million euro of military expenses?
A more well modest budget will contribute to the improvement of the very hard, local living conditions in those valleys situated often at more than 2,000 meters of height.
The Embassy received scores of demands written with small agricultural proposals carried out by local communities of the province of Kapisa.
So that they free itself of the uprising carried out by the foreign groups, something that the farmers have said me that they desire, would do lack to maintain a small civil aid, well controlled and that arrive them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
Is a new double one or nothing of the president Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided that never as for the constitutional statement, that offers him provisionally full powers, he decided to play the all by the all.
It caught to everyone by surprise Wednesday, when announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the head of state had given two months more to said Assembly to finish his works.
And almost two years ago that Egypt uses a provisional text, several times modified, what weakens the institutional stability and carries to judicial muddles.
This new initiative has not done more than enlarging the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and he continues "betraying his word" and "trampling the right".
On the part of its followers, is assured that is a matter of a measure to finish faster with the political and institutional crisis and to accelerate the process of transition.
In the next 15 days should be organized a referendum.
A very short interval of time that obliges the Brothers to renounce its project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, treats also of a form to recover a democratic and popular recognition while the polemics causes havoc in all the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote to its favor, as affirmed in an interview to the American weekly Swindle.
Considering that that resource has voted itself with a lot of rapidity, contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian town: "Or they vote my text or I maintain the full powers", powers that supposedly will arrive at their end with the adoption of the Constitution.
Is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Islamic, Constituent Assembly in its great majority, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of the liberals did not respond to the assembly.
To the middle of November, a little before the constitutional statement, they had closed the door because they reckoned that they could not cause to be worth their points of view.
The representatives of the human rights, the religious minorities and of the civil company they did the same thing.
In order to that the necessary quorum was achieved, yesterday morning was added 11 people, member replacements, as quickly as possible.
Some of them are very the Moslem Brothers.
As it fitted to expect, the articles voted have been it unanimously.
To the commentators grace does them, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day have itself expressed practically at the moment of the prayer, so much is so various members of the committee came they think that the clock of the Constituent was ill.
The text, that yesterday late still was being voted, is comprised of 234 articles.
The article 2, object of all the looks, continues being finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, that stipulated that "the principles of the Sharia constitute the main source of the right".
The parties salafistas, for who the establishment of the Islamic law is a fundamental demand, they expected that they could be substituted "the principles" by "the norms", what to have permitted a stricter application.
For the pro-islamic, that this article have not been modified is a guarantee of its good will and of its respect toward the other components of the Egyptian company.
The liberals erase it of hypocrisy and they consider that itself does not treat more than of an advertising contrivance.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, especially, to the article 220, that confers to the University Al-Azhar a consultative role, particularly for everyone who should to confirm its conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, turns out to be disturbing because "the called people to be pronounced is not chosen and does not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are seen besides increased by the circumstance of that the next rector of said university would be enough less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is not a concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the marital status.
The majority of the jurists that have working in that text they are not ulemas but university, some of them formed in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, that prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that there can be certain ambiguity around the article 220, therefore the employed terms imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in concrete to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that would be able to be presented in the future would be in what measure are the competent civil judges to be pronounced above all this".
Beyond his religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the powers extended that confers the president of the Republic.
The Moslem Brothers will allege that are few in comparison with the ones that were during the previous state.
Another troubled point: the powers conferred to the army.
According to the desire of the soldiers, the review of the budget of Defense will not be submitted to the Parliament, but to a national counsel of defense.
Neither the prosecutions of civilians in military courts will be prohibited, like they asked the associations for the defense of the human rights.
These also they showed their anxieties relating to the text, that consider liberticida.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, the insults are prohibited, what would be able to lead to serious consequences for the freedom of speech, above all that of the press.
Besides, no article emphasizes the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, positive the unique thing has been the prohibition of the torture according to the article 36.
The word did not figure in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president should leave yesterday at night in the television, himself prevén demonstrations for this noon.
The followers of the head of state were declared on Saturday.
In Israel, to the ukrainian tourists expect them the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Land promised combines the majesty of the biblical truths with the modern comfort and a pristine nature.

Reverence in the Holy Land

He is believed that any that enter in this "baptismal battery" will receive the divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water in wine in the wedding, to walk on the water, the mollification of the storm and the full networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greater quantity of holy places is found in Jerusalem.
The believers travel through here the Way of the Cross or the Road of the Cross of Jesus (in latin "Painful Way").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the judgment was carried out, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Grave in the Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and to the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place the symbolic Christian Navel of the world is found also, that symbolizes the salvation of the humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of the one that the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus was done.
In Jerusalem the most sacred place for the Jews he is found also, the Wailing Wall; the remainders of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 DC.
As it is tradition, people of different religions leaves here you note with their desires, that then they will become reality.
Carrying out a vertical trip
The ruins of the Fortress Farm was what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, that Herod the Large one sent to build in the year 25 a. C. for his family.
They are found in the cliffs of mountain to a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to arrive to there by their own media, only they are able those that be dedicated to the escalation.
The others they can arrive at this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north from the country to an altitude of 1600-2040 m the famous ski resort is found Hermón, where in the months of winter there is a great affluence of tourists.
To there, since the foot of the hill services of bus are offered.
The total length of the ski runs is of 45 km.
According to an old legend, in the top of the mountain supposedly they inhabited pagan God.
Visiting unique museums
In this country there is around 300 museums.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth while to visit at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them it is the Museum of Israel, situated near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it the old Manuscripts of the Dead Sea are conserved or Rolls of Qumrán, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and around 500 thousand artifacts and anthropological.

The most tragic section is the Memorial of the children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children murdered in the fields of concentration and the gas chambers.
You enter in it and find you at all darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost the life.
Ukraine is mentioned also.
Health
The three main tourist zones of Israel are found on the banks of the Mediterranean sea, the Red sea and the Dead sea.
In each one of them there are pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red sea they bathe even in the months of winter, since the temperature of the water not drop of the 21 degrees and the air is heated to the 23 degrees.
The Dead sea is still more hot and there they bathe during all the year.
Certainly, this sea, the most extraordinary one in the world, he is found in the lower point of the planet: to 417 m under the sea level.
The blue water of there are a brine that easily maintain until to the ones that do not they know to swim.
The landscapes of the outskirts are truly beautiful.
The people arrives here to pass courses from processing with salt water, brine and curative clays and to fortify its health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for put in order its broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of the antiquity

In Jaffa he can be found couples of newlyweds come from all parts of Israel, and even of other countries to be photographed.
And in Cesarea, the city of the king Herod, can walk through the Roman theater, "to take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In the Roman epoch, Cesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman proxies, included Pontius Pilato.
The theater, carefully restored, is utilized now for nocturnal concerts and spectacles of opera.
Tourists recall
If it travels to Israel, itself worry not if its English leaves much to be desired: in this country around the 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommendable to carry it in euro, but in dollars, that easily they can be changed to shéquels (at present 1-3$,8 shéquels).
The urban transportation is composed chiefly the buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast trolley and in Haifa the only line of meter of the country is found, that is comprised of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In reality, is of a subterranean funicular.
Travelling in any type of public transportation costs 6 shéquels and by this price can travel itself doing change for 1.5 hours.

Israel in figures
In 2012 they visited Israel more than three million tourists of the entire world.
The majority of the ones that came they travel through the country and to rest were citizens of United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Land Promised, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand ukrainian tourists, quantity that surpasses in a 51% to the same index of the year 2010, before the cancellation of the state of visas February 9, 2011.
"The large and powerful one" will carry you to Moscow: immigrant they save for the tongue
While representatives and defenders of the human rights discuss on the consequences that would bring the law on the obligatory exam, already they have appeared in the country swindlers that trade with certificates "false"
Each year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive at Moscow, San Petersburgo and other cities of Russia.
Mostly are citizens of countries of Asia central: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only objective is to win money to help its families that have remained at home.
Since December 1 a law goes into effect, according to which each labor immigrant should carry out an exam to verify his know-how of the Russian tongue.
For now, this rule is applicable only for those that intend to work in the services installment sector, institutions of common services, domestic services and commerce retail.
Nevertheless, with time, like they promise in the Federal Service of Immigration, the exams will be done obligatory for all the immigrants.
Besides, it will not be sufficient with yielding the exam of the tongue, if not also that of Russian history and that of bases of the legislation.
The knowledge of the tongue should be confirmed even to receive and to renew the work permit.
They are exception the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the official tongue.
They will not be you hold to this law the people that managed to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defense of the rights
The network of central examiners will function promoted by the Institute of Russian Tongue Pushkin, the University of the Friendship of the Towns, the State University of Moscow, the State University of San Petersburgo and other institutions of Russian higher education.
The immigrants will be able to be presented to the tests in all the cities, right now in Russia they are open more than 160 centers of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the representatives of the Duma State and by the Federal Service of Immigration.
But the defenders of the rights, a lot before the law went into effect, they achieved many times to ask this question to the press: And what will contribute this in reality?
What changes will bring the obligatory nature of the knowledge of the tongue, so much for the Russians as for the own immigrants?
In the first place, they respond the representatives of the Service of Immigration, this will permit to reduce the number of people that suffer "labor slavery".
Many people speaks today on the defense of the rights of the labor immigrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, leader of the representation of the Federal Service of Immigration of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of its rights should be initiated before its departure.
Only a system of selection organized will permit to resolve the problem of the immigrant workers in a 90% of the cases.
The problems have them the immigrants without profession, education, the ones that do not know the tongue neither they pass the medical control.
Without the comprehension of the tongue, affirms Sebelev, the immigrant future will be seen condemned find people without scruples that, with the pretext to help, they put a "full trip" to an espeluznante and narrow small cave, where he and dozens of other as he are consumed during months without food neither documents, working from 12 to 14 hours to the day.
We receive an endless number of complaints of ours immigrant.
"In its country they promise a thing, but upon arriving they are deceived, is deprived them of its passports, them not the salaries promised pay", confirms the Leader of the Direction of labor immigration of the Service of immigration of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Itself do not get mad, leader!
Not not nevertheless, in the meantime many citizens of the republics of Asia Central that desire to work in Russia they recognize that do only they know the tongue about the country to which they intend to go, but besides in their own tongue they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much its fault but its own misfortune: are few the turkmenos, uzbecos, tayikos that can be given the normal primary luxury to receive education.
This themselves due to that its families even do not have anything that to feed the children, by speak not already to dress them, to wear them and to buy them the necessary thing for the school.
Upon arriving at the adolescence, these boys venture to work to the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if themselves not the tongue is known, they recognize they.
"One it feels humiliated and lower".
Nevertheless, in which refers to the law on the tongue, the defenders of the rights indicate an important point.
The exams will be carry out only for those immigrants whose status be legal.
If they do not have that status, there will not be neither exam and, consequently, no official work.
In the meantime, the majority of the immigrant workers they continue living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or it prohibited the step to strange"
Many visitors affirm that to receive the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the tongue in itself.
Besides, the legalization costs money: of twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
Nevertheless, a false inscription can be done quickly and by only thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that generally we carry false documents, we are not recorded and the cases of extortion appear.
"A hundred they ask us or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea", commented the journalists the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"We go, be not stingy, purchase a painting"
The first day of the entrance in vigor of the law on the tongue, was shown that not only the immigrants registration documents can be false.
Various certificates "false" of knowledge of the tongue already have been seized for officials of the Federal Service of Immigration.
The fake documents had been printed in standard printers of color.
Of course, they arrived at the hands of the new owners not as gift: each immigrant, being wanted to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times and more expensive middle than the official procedure of exam, that will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a next future is to protect the system against the corruption so that the "diplomas" cannot be bought, they converge the officials of the government and the defenders of the rights.
Up to now, the authorities can promise the immigrant workers that had not been able to pass with success the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the tongue.
Besides, to the immigrants that do not speak Russian them will be offered works that do not require active communication with the people.
The Interior Ministry does not take drastic measures against the illegal commerce of weapons
The percentage of committed crimes with registered weapons is enough reduced
The Interior Ministry proposes to apply the law with greater inflexibility relating to the civil use weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the government before the recent incidents: Pressing shots during celebrations of anniversaries in which luckily did not there were victims, and the massacre initiated by the lawyer Muscovite Dimitri Vinográdov, in which to Press seven people lost the life.
The police wants to prohibit the use and the possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to elevate the minimum age for the obtaining of license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the jefa of the committee of the Duma in matter of security and fight against the corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the law on the possession arm you will be carried to the Duma of the State in a next future.
Not all they feel happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counteract this problem applying the "political of hard hand".
In the network a letter has appeared open, whose authors, representatives of diverse social organizations of marksmen, they require that desist of such measures of "meaningless rigorousness".
The vandalism acts percentage with use of registered weapons is minimum, commented to the service of news BBC of Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics of the Interior Ministry, during six months of the year 2012 142 crimes with use of registered firearms in organs of the Interior were committed, set against the total of 1168 registered crimes for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a stricter legislation in the civil use weapons sector will not be an objection so that the delinquent be directed to the black market.
Now, according to its words, in Moscow any weapon to low price can be found.
In the meantime, in the Interior Ministry is affirmed that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is found low control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market of weapons supplies through various channels.
The main channels are years, the colonel withdrawn says Víctor Baranets, who for ten years he worked in the Department of Education and in the High one Been Greater.
It captures of screen of the website that accepts orders of weapons
The first one, "trace of the I exercise or military", that is to say, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officials and by the same Caucasian", he says Baranets.
The following type of "arms black", them stolen by delinquents and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here the weapons stolen of the stores of the police are included and those stolen directly by officials of the organs of compliance of the law.
The illegal weapons go on sale since the military arsenals.
In many military arsenals often there were explosions.
"Versions shown exist that some fires were caused premeditated to cover the lack", comments an exmilitar.
According to Baranets, the arms manufacturers also put their granite of sand.
"Now private factories of weapons have proliferated that are not competitive in the international market and they distribute you arm low cord to the black market, included that of Moscow", the expert says.
A source more than the black market is the contraband.
Great quantity of guns and machine guns stem from poor countries as Kirguistán.
"There they include his own production, at times craft, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons", explains the former soldier.
From where the weapons come?
The experts have calculated which is the approximate participation of each one of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this theme was elaborated in 2011 by the problems analysis Center and planning of the public management.
The specialists analyzed reports of the Interior Ministry and of Rosstat, bibliography criminológica and data of public access of entries whose subject matter tour around the weapons.
The great majority of the illegal weapons, according to the investigators, the armed forces stem from and of the security forces.
The half of the weapons of the black market has arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to the weapons", is said in the report.
According to the investigators, the 17% of the weapons places stem from where there are armed conflicts, the 14% of the cases is stolen during the production of weapons and the 5% corresponds to the "illegal archeology".
The clerk of one of the stores of weapons, that asked that its surname did not were mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators not the purchase nobody for already a lot of time because are too much old woman.
Most often, he says, the suppliers are directed to military stores when they need a departure.
Through some subaltern, the supplier buys a unit, for example a gun TT.
They eliminate it of the registration and they pass it over the fence.
"This carries the weapon to the city and sells it to 900 euro by unit with two dockhands", counts us
"But, clear, the police this to the so much one of all the matters, so periodically, when one must comply the crimes discovery plan, they carry out purchases of test to the merchants of illegal weapons", adds the clerk.
"As in a boutique of luxury"
The salesperson and the buyer are used to finding acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a type that proposed me that went to the platform" Begovaya", where would be a man that would carry me to a "corner" where we would be able to negotiate.
Of the price of the weapon, I informed me only there".
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To obtain a weapon I need a friend that have contacts", the clerk of the store says. "I have a friend thus, but I do not trust a lot in it".
In the markets there are salespersons, but there has also to arrive, we say "on behalf of the Mr. Ivanovih, that asked that told that a tooth had fallen to its daughter".
Even I can obtain a steel mittens pair through a person of confidence.
He also supplies him me only me because he knows that him do not I be going to betray.
The novices seek weapons of different ways.
The former soldier Viktor Baranets was put to test in illegal weapons buyer the role of in the middle of the years 1990, when he was arranged to publish an article on this theme.
The plans, according to their words, they have not changed.
They delivered him an album of photos where there was not "of all".
"I felt as in a boutique of luxury", recalls the soldier.
To the buyer, according to words of Baranets, him do not they offer cat by hare: everything that there is can be tested.
I, as potential client, do not only I buy; we go with the salesperson to the forest, where we put a white one.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure me that the unlike weapon well, we begin to negotiate", describes the procedure the expert.
Store of sofas
The search engines web conduct to places and groups of "Vkontakte", where is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this no document is required neither personal encounters.
"It is sufficient to have a certain quantity of money", they write in the holder of the advertising notice "to Buy a gun or a machine gun".
There the users do its orders and put questions.
And they sell to under age?
"Without permission, of course", question to the user "Iván" (orthography conserved).
"I buy gun TT. Moscow", laconically formulates its question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Service of Security has created an enormous network of fictitious websites and capture to two hands to those that desire to buy firearms.
And the people goes, as hungry fish toward the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and exmilitar Viktor Baranets
I have heard to speak of these systems: generally, the website is registered out of the reach of the Russian laws.
The people does the orders.
The buyer carries out the payment through an ATM.
"In answer, send a photo and the instructions so that know where is hidden the weapon", relates the press secretary of the NGO "The right to the weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets affirms that if is done an order in line, one remains without weapon and they put it in the jail.
The Federal Service of Security has created an enormous network of fictitious websites and capture to two hands to those that desire to buy firearms.
"And the people goes, as hungry fish toward the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia", affirms he.
Makarov for 100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to the experts, one can be spent from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to the weapons", a gun Makarov can be acquired for 100-300 dollars.
A month should be expected and medium.
It is sent since the military stores by the leaders of medium rank.
According to the official statistics of the department, in comparison with the period January-October of 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced in a 7%, what constitutes 22,900, and the number of identifying cases of robbery and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosive and bombs diminished in a 7,8%.
They are put in strike the fast food restaurants employees and supermarkets in United States.
To one fourth of American adolescents they find their first works as the cashiers in "McDonald' s"
In the last days, in the United States a wave of protests against the low salaries has been initiated that are paid in the supermarkets of the corporation Walmart and in restaurants of the popular fast-food chains, such as "McDonald' s", "hamburger Joint King", "Plug Bell", "Wendy' s" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now nobody dares to assert if he will arrive or not this wave to the nine points, or if he has destined to lose forces and to be calmed in his first phases.
The actions of protest include the support of the unions and of a left NGO series.
Besides the increase of the modest salaries perceived by the workers of Walmart and the of the system of fast food, the objective of the organizers of the protests is the workers unions creation in these businesses.
For now, this sector of the economy practically has not been occupied by the union movement.
Forty-six cents to the year?
The actions began last week, after the thanksgiving day, the call "Black Friday". That day, in the United States coomenzaba the orgy of discounts that captured to millions of inhabitants, and that at times was accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers of the corporation Walmart, that employs 2.2 million people in the world, they abandoned their jobs and they formed pickets of protest next to the unions and activists of left in the stores of the corporation, whose products are directed to people of modest incomes and moderates.
Walmart sells of all, from diapers, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are of average between a 8% and a 27% cheaper than the of the largest supermarkets.
That it is why many badly full workers of Walmart buy only in the work.
The availability and the assortment of products they have done of Walmart one of the largest corporations of America.
According to the words two critics, Walmart can be permitted the luxury to sell products to very low price, in part because pays little to its workers.
These last also complain of the bad labor conditions, such as the lack of freight elevator or scanners of hand.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration required the increase of salaries and they complained that the price of the insurance of health supplied by the corporation passed from 30 to 100 monthly dollars.
For a typical worker of Walmart, that receives 9.5 dollars for hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists of the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart enlarges the medium salary until 12$ for hour, this will cost to the corporation 3.2 billion dollars.
This is approximately a 1.1% more than what spends in salaries now.
If Walmart places the pay raise in the shoulders of the consumers, each visit to the store will result them only 46 more expensive cents.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous quantity of 12.39 dollars more than what spend now.
The followers of Walmart comment satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was prolonged in its stores since the 8 in the afternoon on Thursday to the midnight of the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5000 articles by second.
On the whole, its boxes cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the business, they Give Fogelman, declared in an interview to the website of left Huffington Post, that left its job "less than five" employed of Walmart and that the protest had not been more than "another trick of public relations", organized by the union of workers.
"¡Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not exactly the large stores Walmart (that in this progressive city do not have them appreciation, and therefore for now there is not none), but the "McDonald' s" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald' s says that sells thousands of millions of portions, and then not even they grant you the drop by illness and you do not they pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the town Council of new York
At present, according to the federal law and the of new York, the minimum wage is of 7.25$ for hour.
The restaurants of fast food go it enlarging with time, but only slightly, and of average, the ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars for hour.
Nobody wins less than they in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me is somewhat incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost one fourth of the American adolescents they passed for the McDonald' s and they worked there, behind the counters, part-time after the school, although still they lived with their parents.
Few they were the ones that saw this as the main source of income or planned to be remained there a lot of time.
Now, constantly I stumble in some interviews with workers of McDonald' s that complain that they have to live on this salary, and at times even to feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the magazine Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author indicates that he is irresponsible to have children if he does not know with what to feed.
The participants in the protests, that began to the 6:30 in the morning on Thursday in the McDonald' s of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, they required that to the cashiers and cooks of fast food is harmed them to pay for at least 15$ for hour, that is to say, that be duplicated them its current minimum wage.
Also they required that in the sector of the fast food unions of workers are believed.
The law of the United States prohíbe to the administration to impede them this right and to punish the activists of the union movement with sophistries and dismissals.
On the other hand, rare time the administration facilitates them the life.
But, by objective reasons, is easy that the unions cover the sector of food rápid.
One of the main is the excessive rotation of the personnel.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place to half of the rally in the McDonald' s situated near Times Square, in which they participated various local democratic politicians, particularly the member of the town Council of the city Jumaane Williams, that said: "McDonald' s says that is selling thousands of millions of portions, and then not even a hospital gives you neither pays you by your honest work".
The demonstrators received the support of other noticeable democrats of new York, for example of the candidate to mayor of the city Bill of Blasio, that said that "we should support the workers of the sector of fast food so that they manage to receive just salaries and the economic prosperity that deserves each neoyorkino".
As the periodic one described it New York Times, this has been the greater demonstration of this type in the American history of the fast food.
But in her participated only a few hundreds of people, even not all they were employees of the service of fast food, in which trabakan scores of thousands of people of new York.
Not yet it is clear if this will serve of spark to cause a massive movement.
"For now, to deceive to the brain does not turn out to be so easy"
The theme of the reality enlarged, so popular among the fans to the modern technologies, ultimately is perceived with normality chiefly through the prism of special eyeglasses.
To starts of the summer, in its conference annual Google showed a model in movement and subsequently, in November, was known that Microsoft had presented also a request to demand the corresponding patent.
Nevertheless, of a conversation with the leader of the group of interactive technology 3D in the laboratory of Microsoft of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, was clarified that for the scientists of said company, the eyeglasses already belonged to a passed phase.
To them the perspective of the handling of virtual objects in the air with the naked hands attracts them and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, ¿which is the object of study of its research team?
- We dedicate Us to the interaction person-computer, but besides we try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now the humanity in its great mass has remained trapped in the phase of work with the pixels of the flat screen, at times he touches it with the finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and to guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the console Xbox and the sensors Kinect represent a step ahead and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since to all the control by gestures interests them.
- ¿What more grants us the future?
- In spite of the fact that Kinect has carried the interaction at the physical level, great part of this still occurs in a flat screen, at times in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the exit yet is not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work in systems of truly three-dimensional viewing, based different technologies, including those of design.
It should free the world of the data processing to ours, to the physicist, to do it more tangible.
For this, nevertheless, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects of a more comfortable form.
In the first place, ¡to the devil with those foolish helmets of virtual reality!
- ¿What do you think on the control by voice?
A very popular detail, but ¿does not he believe that they overestimate it?
- Of course themselves him cannot be considered a panacea, remains slope to resolve the question of privacy, since always is not wanted that the others they be informed of our actions and intentions.
In fact, all the types of interaction with computers are good, but each one in their own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gestures, but not in loose, but shorter movements.
Besides, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that registered the movement of the bones and the muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a type combined of control, for example of gesture + voice.
- ¿How is that?
- For example, ¿how would you ask me you that this tin plating of soda passed him?
You will speak and will show it at the same time.
- Normally I only speak.
- Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognize.
- ¿That is to say, you want to oblige the users to be adapted to what or cannot do at this time the machine?
- Not necessarily, but is a mutual approach.
I believe that in a next future we are going to have that to work chiefly in the sensors of new types design that can determine with precision the reactions of the person.
These they can be, for example, sensors laser, since they provide a good resolution in depth, what is very important.
- If we speak of its work with the sensors of Xbox Kinect, ¿what complaints have you of the modern cameras?
Resolution lacks them, depth or something more?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, would be good to obtain 8 megapíxeles to the velocity of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapíxeles, but in the quality of the headquarters and in the depth.
Since this last point of view, all the current technologies are not it sufficient good for us; this gives more I work the designers of algorithms.
That is to say, that we have to recall not only the resolution in the axes X and AND, but also in Z.
Is also important the velocity, the number of pictures by second.
The human movements are quite dynamic and the current of 30 fps are truly scarce, above all for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our laboratory in Redmond, did a sensor of contact with adjustable delay of prosecution from 1 to 100 ms and fits to mention that the modern sensors produced in series are more near the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands in what measure this affects to the interaction man-machine.
It would be me me to very useful for my work an equivalent one of such device, but that require not contact so that the pictures by second be more.
- ¿AND is not necessary to enlarge the number of cameras?
- The Kinect has now three "cameras", one of the which is in fact the transmitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the sign reflected.
But the third camera is in reality a simple sensor of the visible pitch.
This it is not utilized to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more quantity of cameras they would be able to resolve the problem...
Or to the contrary, to enlarge it and to increase the quantity required of calculations.
It would be good to create an analogous flexible one of Kinect, to play with the curvature of location of the cameras and to see how would this help determinr the three-dimensional position.
- For which I remember, Microsoft, as opposed to Google, has not presented its eyeglasses to the public.
Him does not seem that, since the point of view of the daily use of technologies of reality enlarged, the eyeglasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, to pass all the while maintaining in high an intelligent telephone in the hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a reality enlarged "transmutable" when, in base of a platform of cloud, you would be able to pass from the eyeglasses to the intelligent telephone,
The eyeglasses are very personal devices, in that is its force (the private things only you will be able to see them), but also its weakness: a reality enlarged based on eyeglasses will not permit him to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- Imaginémonos for a moment that the handling of objects holográficos virtual in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that the critics are used to indicating: There is not tactile answer!
The hands do not feel anything!
What answers prepares its group for this challenge?
- In my conferences often I say that the reality enlarged is the seventh raid in the interaction between the man and the machine.
I believe that the octave well could be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as backup for the image.
It registers the touch perfectly!
But technologies exist also that are truly oriented to contribute tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of various ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where is found the finger gives a similar sensation to which one feels if someone was blowing him in the fingertips, but that sensation still is very weak.
There are also bracelets for the wrist that influence in the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- ¿They tried to deceive to the brain?
Cause to think that he feels what seems that he should feel just as he sees something?
- That is a good idea, yet we have not tried it.
Here it hides another challenge with the one that will have to fight for a long time, how to do that a person physically located in a space very reduced creates that he goes to an open space, almost without end. We are working also in the idea of the tapes to run (not as those of the gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as that of the gigantic globes.
For now, to deceive to the brain does not turn out to be so easy, still one must work for many years.
That is what does attraction the work with the virtual reality for the investigators, that many things are found in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal flavor instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "ultramodern Style of San Petersburgo", dedicated the citizens that are found before, to the vanguard of the art and of the culture.
In this list of the better brilliant figures of the art they are found and the scene of San Petersburgo, whose achievements arrive beyond the city: often they find recognition in Europe without Russia know them even.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
All the city knows to Kirill Miller, a man bearded dress of red from top to bottom, to which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Garden of Summer or in fashionable meetings and inaugurations.
The pictures of Kirill Miller always attract to multitudes, where he want that they be exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those informers purely sociofilósofos of San Petersburgo, creative of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the ultramodern style of San Petersburgo of ends of the 80 - principles of the 90.
Besides, is an urban man, whose apparition in the streets of the city awakes in the inhabitants smiles and raises to all the state of spirit.
Recently, it took in its hands a hurdy-gurdy and became the organ grinder of San Petersburgo, since has matured to do so difficult role, by its existence Bohemia, its philosophy and its image.
- Kirill, ¿why do you go for the city dressed of red and not of yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I Elected the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate me to the appearance and to the image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment among the artist, the creators of images and the company.
Although in the company, everything that be a little gray stirs up aggressiveness and good nothing properties agitation.
But my provocations are directed to that a conversation be initiated.
All the history of my provocative actions they are an invitation to the debate.
- ¿When did you understand that should be an artist?
- In an exposition of the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that that was my road.
Then the wave of old artists not officials had finished, and the new, free like I, they were still misunderstood.
I made friend of artists of the new wave, with the subsequent to the ones that they were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, that carried to “Pushkinskaya-10", and already the new wave was finished.
I plunged myself in the theater by the clothes, the music of all the kinds, but not by the letters.
- AND all this joined in your Clinic of art... - For me was important to find me in the arts center of San Petersburgo, where should meet the better creative minds.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was not you reform, a musical artistic club existed, a bohemian club, the house of the Bohemia of San Petersburgo.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, memory the way in which Schnur brought to the project to "The ear of they Go Gogh".
Schnur and its friends sang low light songs fonograma, they dressed adjusted pants, among them was the at present fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to touch in alive, became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was a host of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of its great career; the basic education and formation received it of us.
Gallery "D 137", the" Club Griboyedov, are the remainders of the Clinic of the Art.
There they went ours employed and assiduous clients.
I am a hero of last century, when the culture signified something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected I, thus finished my culmination.
In these new times is not comfortable to work; I am a man to which he likes the truth, the uprightness and the culture of last century.
In our times is easy to be done popular, but the culture and the popularity go separated. One can be popular but very little worship.
- There is in your somewhat recognizable works.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them itself express train clearly the present time and the occurrence.
I am going to do an exposition planned, "The Russian Museum in clowns".
The clowns are a timeless category.
I before was sociable, but now to be thus is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns all is besmeared and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque thing, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by means of an obligatory and totalitarian change of clothes.
Now to one they continue it for the clothes, being oriented in the external thing, but not in the interior of the person.
And, perhaps to that person be not owed her neither to give the hand, but to spit him in the face.
And the deceit will be eliminated when change of clothes.
- It Does little we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - A cultured city should have a hero thus.
Who better than I to be it!
- Well but, ¿maybe the commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art should be scrupulous, sweet, to be tactful.
We are being witnesses of the disintegration of the cultures.
Before the people was grouped in flowed, the bohemians wanted a thing, the gullible other.
Now all they have been divided into microcomunidades, is difficult to please to all.
I am not a bill of a hundred dollars to like them to all.
Now one must think who do you want to like.
Now, each hero of worship has his 100 fans.
- ¡AND to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive for thousands!
- They Are going to see it them abandoned, there the sex-social sphere functions.
And to a cultural event go 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a consequence, less management, less money, all itself wilted.
I have to my fans, it more important is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When it was a youth did such pictures that a collector the hanging tapeworm in the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I began with paintings, with the ones that generally the people finishes.
Now often they confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
Not any culture in the consumption exists, that is another history.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew under the example of artists that lived in the poverty and morían in the poverty, they refused the money only to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, ¿what is what lacks to San Petersburgo?
- Good expert in culture.
A concept exists: official of the culture.
But not all they can be dedicated to the culture.
When the kings were the correct all was otherwise, the kings perhaps did not understand very well the culture, but they knew that was necessary to maintain the correct experts.
In Moscow now there are very good consultants.
We have people in San Petersburgo that well could be experts, but they are closed, because experts to an upper level are needed that evaluate correctly to these and they break them through.
Now is prospering the subjective personal flavor.
The same thing Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all the modern art is accepted, there are some artists that have to seek other museums.
- ¿What is for you San Petersburgo?
- San Petersburgo is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is a lot of more culture, there there is land.
But on our stones is difficult that the art grow.
We need cultural land and we have now more writers than readers, this is ill.
In Europe there is a pile of people with curiosity that goes to expositions and concerts.
In our case, this class is negligible.
We have to do that the art be fashionable, as went it at the beginning of last century.
The project will be executed with a subsidy of San Petersburgo.
Give birth in the space
The Land is in danger.
Global warming-up or collision with a murderous asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board leave in search of a planet of replacement.
To conserve the humanity asks the main question: How continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or in the same planet of replacement?
I believe that there is little where to elect.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These they are a Venus and Mars", the chief investigator of the State Astronomical Institute says, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Mars are better for the life, in the surface of Venus the temperature is of 500 degrees.
Only he can live to large altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in the space.
It began to undertake the problems of reproduction in the space with the flora.
It does already half century that experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas cultivated in orbit were differentiated in nothing of the terrestrial varieties.
Later came the young of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosófilas.
In 1979 they were sent to the bobwhite eggs space to verify how develops the embryo in conditions of weightlessness.
We obtain as a result a normal chick.
But then they begin the problems.
"The problem is in which this chick has to find support, should be maintained on its own feet and to begin to be moved", explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Academy of Sciences of Russia.
Upon not finding support, the chicks gave somersaults at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
The chicks did not react to the light neither to the sound.
And the misfortune was that at the end of four days simply itself morían.
"And two times we obtain that to be born the chicks, but then we leave it because was impossible to work there with them",, comments Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in the space.
The last time that a "miniarca" biological flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of the 2013 they will continue the experiments.
Nevertheless, in the biosatélite "Bion" only will travel species from a same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, that were envoys to the space already with fetuses.
In principle, himself supernatural nothing he was found.
"This was exactly in the biosatélites, but this was an unique experiment, and studies as this should be carry out", comments Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the spatial rats had descent.
Nevertheless, yet it has not managed to undertake itself the problem of the reproduction directly in the space.
Is a difficult challenge.
The animals, upon losing their habitual habitat, simply they cannot carry out their sexual urge.
The man, nevertheless, as opposed to the small animals, in principle, is able.
The Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an adequate emotional fund.
Similar experiments are not carry out by reasons ethics.
But the women travel to the space since already 50 years ago.
The major risk passed it Tereshkova.
And it more prized than has the humanity is the female agency.
Our seagull flying, and nobody in the Land would be able to say: if he is after a flight to the space.
Will be able or not to have a baby after this flight.
"After all, to this question nobody has responded", he comments the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June of 1964, only after a year of the flight to the space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who two times was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
Nevertheless, the risk persists.
We are few, are cash the astronauts to whom after long flights all have them turned out well, and a healthy generation comes growing.
"And if it can be told more, is dangerous even in orbital flights", summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, the humanity should seek some new ways in the biotechnology, in the radiological protection, in the creation of the artificial gravity.
The hidrolaboratorio of the cosmonauts preparation Center is an obligatory phase in the preparation for the flight.
In conditions of flotabilidad null, the cosmonauts practice their abilities of work in the space.
The water simulates the weightlessness.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable, although still hostile environment, for a boy newborn is its native element.
The small men-amphibious they seem to confirm that the life in the land arose of the ocean.
There is a connection among the fact that the baby be found approximately 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic liquid, therefore will be easier to be been accustomed then to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because since the moment of the birth up to now of the first bath pass only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something", Navy says Aksenova, monitora of swimming of newborns.
All in all, if the weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for the women is necessary the gravitation, the force of the gravity.
In the weightlessness the abdominal muscles and of the pelvis itself decrepitan very fast, the capacity of expulsion of the fetus is reduced.
Good, we omit that, trusting in the action of stimulants for the labor.
It is able, of course, to give birth in a special camera, this will push it.
"¿And then what?", Valeri Polyakov this original question is done.
On the other hand, the boy also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation seriously, the agency does not generate the skeleton neither the muscular system.
To a newborn in orbit is impossible to dress it with a special suit for training, as to the adults.
Simply him it will be deprived of what is vital for him.
"And this experiment that are going to do together, upon permitting the birth of a boy in a strange environment, will give rise to that we bring to the Land to a disabled one, to a person completely inadaptada", foresees the leader of the committee of bioethics of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in the space is a theoretical question.
Nevertheless, with the time this will be a reality, when the human beings in its ships be directed to a distant planet that will be the home for its born children in the space.
Leader of NKÚ: The inspection of the system “švarc" has not hit upon the guilty politician
In matter of public awarding, the Czech Republic counts on good inspectors and a legislation of quality, although its application limps.
Thus it affirms it Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKÚ) in an interview for.
"The law never will be perfect", but its application should be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what lacks us", thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech inspectors and Germans also arrive at similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, mentions the attitude of Petr toward the autonomous system to be only on the role, that is known like the system “švarc".
The prime minister said recently that the ODS (Parted Democratic Civic) would not bother the businessmen with inspectors. Then, ¿it is prohibited or permitted?
"The law should be regular of some way and if prohíbe something, in that case, neither the president of the government can impede the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out you said controls neither to require obligations", he verifies Kala.
In the meeting of the commission of control in the Congress of the Representatives, you spoke of the common project between the Czech team and the German, in the framework of which the referring legislation to the public awarding in both countries was compared.
What is exactly?
It is a matter of a parallel control that begin to carry out some two years ago.
They said of way simplified: the European legislation normalizes how the public awarding should be organized, to this the legislation continues him in force in each country and, later, the praxis in itself.
We have united it all and, although the control not yet has finalized, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", nevertheless, the praxis concrete in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is confirmed, therefore, that does not suffice with incorporating rules increasingly more strict, but is necessary to be concentrate on the same law enforcement.
What can contribute in fact this project? Which does it believe that are the conclusions?
Exactly a common control of this type would be able to contribute to that to stopped investing efforts in the concreteness of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, although this have not a so positive impact.
The economy of the savings signifies to obtain an adequate thing to a reasonable price (what does not always signify that the price be the lower one) to avoid thus the enrichment and, eventually, the criminal actions.
But not by the circumstance of reducing the limit of the awarding means that we be going to obtain it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", that those that want to seek failures in the system they will be able to do it more easily than if the limits were maintained as high as now.
You speak of the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that to regulate the practice of the public awarding.
How the system of controls in Germany functions?
It is an office seemed to our NKÚ or is organized otherwise?
In how much to the offices, like the NKÚ, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with a similar organization to ours, with a school also, the unique thing is that in their case is structured of an a little different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the competences are up to a point analógas, nevertheless, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are found even to this level. In this aspect differs slightly of our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) only can control the federal money, what here call state funds.
The public funds, that are administered for the regions and the municipalities, there, in Germany, they are controlled in the Federal Court of Accounts.
As for the local legislation, ¿is simpler than ours?
Generally, i would not like to establish a comparison without concrete data. Nevertheless, Germany continues being a model in some aspects, but itself cannot be needed with accuracy in what is better.
Could be better, for example, as for the quality of the inspectors?
That sure not, but, I repeat, i do not like to do this type of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that take as model should face a great number of problems.
If it was not thus, not no benefit would suppose them to collaborate with our office, ¿does not believe?
As for the legislation of our country, ¿what signified for its Office the amendment of law on the public awarding? It is declared of some way its incident?
Keeping in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, not yet has been declared in the actions of control.
It given that we carry out former controls post, is precise to include a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of the future controls: we have initiated a new tool of "detection of not economic risks", by the one that we have done to pass almost 14,000 public awarding, that have been analyzed. The changes will be seen perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the process of selection are rectified and similar.
It considers that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, more well, supposes a muddle for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the correct direction and I expect that thus be.
The problem that can arise is that the regulation "harden" and that be impossible to comply it.
Already with the previous regulation, the people controlled were linked the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operating programs of the regional counsel), and each law done not respect in matter of public awarding signified the violation of the budgetary discipline.
Sense makes then to harden the law in this manner?
I believe that not in this manner.
The system should exclude to those that quieran to attack it or to be take advantage of him and not to punish to those that commit a formal failure, that does not have incident in it takes of decisions.
A system of this type only will manage to create a greater bureaucratic pressure.
This and how leaves?
We will see toward where this road initiated carries us.
The prime minister has declared recently that the ODS would not bother the businessmen with controls of the call system švarc, with reference to the autonomous fact to be only on the role. What does this signify?
The system švarc" is prohibited or permitted?
The law should be regular of some way and, if prohíbe something, then not even the prime minister of the government can impede the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out you said controls and to require obligations.
He can say: "We change the law and we permit him", but he cannot say that we will do as if nothing.
In the law on the public awarding, the regulation is quite strict as for the way in which should be acted formally. And thus it is like should be to protect the public competence.
But, on the other hand, is tragic that be excluded the candidate with the best offering by comply not the formal demands.
The law never will be perfect, but its application should be correct. This is, in my opinion, what lacks us.
The highways present plates of ice, although mostly they are passable
In various places of the Czech Republic the highways present plates of ice and of snow.
Although the majority of the ways they are passable, in some should be maximized the precaution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
Today in the morning the highways in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but they presented plates of ice and of snow.
The temperature descends and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has left to snow in the region and in the low zones the blanket of snow is fine.
On the other hand, in the crests of the Metallic Mounts the snow reaches almost the 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still evil on account of the fog, according to the information of the operations control center of the highways of the region.
The fast way R6 and the highway of first category in the region are now passable without restrictions.
Nevertheless, it is recommended to maximize the precaution, above all in some bridges whose surface can be frost and to be slippery.
Likewise, also they are passable all the ways of second and third category, included the highways of mountain.
Nevertheless, in some of them still there are sections with remainders of ice and snow rammed.
Is precise to enlarge the attention in the highway, above all in the highest zones.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some highways of Bohemia oriental there is danger of frosts and in higher zones and in the mountains should have formed a blanket of snow in the ways, reports in its pages the Direction of highways and freeways.
The operatives of highways notify the conductors on the danger that plates of ice be formed, especially in higher zones of the region of Pardubice.
They can be produced frosts in the surrounding area of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and above all in the highways of second and third category.
The highways I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treaties chemically.
There is snow especially in the highways of the mountains of Krkonošand to Orlické hory.
There is a blanket of snow rammed in the highest zones of the highways in the municipalities of Rychnov nad and Trutnov.
In the zone of the Bohemia oriental, the sky will be today among cleared and partly cloudy, without haste.
The temperatures will oscillate generally among three below zero and a positive degree, will blow a weak wind.
Region of Beer
The highways in the region of Beer are passable today in the morning, although should be maximized the precaution and will be necessary to be adapted to the time.
In the first hours in the morning there will be frosts, the temperatures will oscillate between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and of the subsequent descent of the temperatures, some ways would also be able to be covered with ice.
In some places the conductors will be found with fog, but the visibility will improve progressively.
This is what is removed of the informations of the highways operations control center of the region.
The freeway D5 is passable almost without restrictions, although is recommended to maximize the precaution, above all in the way between the kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of the majority of the highways of first category is dry and without ice.
In the zone of the highway of Beer and Tachov frontier with Germany there can be sections with plates of ice.
The ways of second and third category are humid, for which, in this case, also is notified of sections with plates of ice.
The conductors should be more prudent, especially in the ways less traveled in the zone of Šumava.
Region of Olomouc
The conductors that be directed to the highest zones of the region of Olomouc they will be found with snow partly waste.
After the chemical processing, still remained snow in the port of and in the way in direction to Videlský.
The operatives of highways removed the snow during the night; in the highway of Šumper accumulated some three centimeters of snow, according to the administrators of the ways.
In the remainder of the region, the majority of ways they are passable without restrictions.
"In the highest zones of the highway of Šumper, they remain remainders of snow.
The conductors in the port of will be found with snow half a waste in direction to Jeseník", has confirmed today an operative of the administration of highways of Šumper to the.
On the land and at night they responded to the Jesenická also its colleagues and, after the chemical processing, the trails of the highest zones are now cleared and wet.
In the highway of Olomouc the ways are passable without restrictions, in that of Šternberská the conductors should conduct with precaution in the forest sections, where the ways continue being humid.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
The users of the north highways of Bohemia have reported on complications in different sections first thing in the morning in the morning.
Aside from some places in which has snowed or ice cream, according to the database of the police the highway of mountain between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures are maintained below zero, even in the lowest zones, for which the ice and the snow obviously remain in it worn. On the other hand, in the lowest zones, especially in the southeast of the solid Czech head office, there is not problems and the highways, generally, they are dry.
By the mmento not complications of service have been registered.
The users of highways have notified of the presence of ice in the outskirts of.
According to the meteorologists, the conditions have been ideals during the night. During the day expects rain and snow that melts and at night the sky will be cleared and there will be ice.
Since the main roads unfavorable conditions in the highway have been announced I/13, in the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The highway between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched on the way with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
He is said that in little less than one month is going to arrive the end of the world, ¿what thinks on it?
Only is an of among so many other alarmist news to the ones that we like to get us.
To the group of music The Tap Tap we like more well to do jokes on this and us likes to say that we are the only group of music of the world that sufficient positive energy manages to meet to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Besides, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
It can explain it to him our readers?
It is a matter of a state beneficial act that carry planning since two years ago.
We decide to take advantage of the potential of marketing that has the end of the calendar Mayan statement for December 21 to the 11:10 in the morning.
The previous day, December 20 at 21 o'clock, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will finish approximately to the same hour in which finishes the Mayan calendar in the island Kiribati, in the Peaceful Ocean, 12 hours by in front of our time zone.
To who occurred him himself this idea?
Initially it was my idea, later we were forging the project all along with our designer Honza August.
Besides wanted to meet sufficient positive energy and to avoid the end of the world, also we want to reflect, along with the company, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
With occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar also we have created an unique collection of articles: boots, undershirts, markets and original keys rings against the end of the world that can be acquired in www.e-tap.cz, another form to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the call hymn against the end of the world, that carries for title "End of the world, canceled".
At present is very popular in YouTube, ¿will be able to hear in the beneficial concerts?
Clearly so and it will be just the last, good one, provided that all turn out well and itself not the world be finished...
All the they will sing it interpreters at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be bound among itself simultaneously thanks to the special broadcast in direct in the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and interprets the role protagonist of Jesus in the video clip, where also sings Xindl X...
How this contribution arose?
We work jointly even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, aside from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts...
We put all our pledge in participating in this project.
It has been shown that to the majority of them interests them and entertains them to work with us.
Why the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world will be destined?
To equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, that we carry to term in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in ústav.
The students of the school of ústav receive regularly the visit of professors with the ones that carry out amusing and interesting activities.
The students do not have sufficient economic media to pay the professors and we do an efuerzo to make possible.
In the framework of the finalización of the works in ústav, an independent building will exist to which we will transfer us with this project.
In each concert they act various groups and interpreters.
Which are the criteria of selection?
We try to devise a program that be attraction for all the generations, included the children.
For example, in Prague they will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with they Give Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Suchý.
To obtain more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
You have predicted some another "spectacular action" similar in the future?
In May we will act for the first time in the festival arum lily, so here surely we will prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year also us would like to touch in the Bohemian National Foyer of new York and to me, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, i would like to complete it with actions in Washington and in Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalists, up to now you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, nevertheless, a group formed by people with disability.
How is the logistics and the organization of these trips?
Is not so difficult how can seem at first sight.
There are five members in electric wheelchair, the chairs should travel in the compartment for luggages and besides we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
Nevertheless, up to now we have fixed them us well. And British Airways were perfectly prepared, thing that not to stops surprising me.
Even in Moscow, of where we have returned does little, left all without problems.
Thanks to the exits to the foreigner you can compare the different attitudes of the company toward the disabled and other aspects.
With what have you found you up to now?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, all functions better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that, in the east, remains a lot of road by traveling through.
As opposed to Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there continues without being frequent that a person is displeased alone by the center of the city in an electric wheelchair.
Something as current as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in wheelchair in elevator, there it is not.
Luckily, a civil association has been created that endeavors for tematizar the problems of the people with disability.
In what aspects we should take more advanced example of countries?
There are many aspects in which we go from behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the people to the ones that affects directly.
In London and in Madrid is very normal that the people with a serious disability is displeased for its account in public and can go to the service, to the museum, where want...
But is not very common that a great number of people with disability they participate in the social life of active form, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap ¡we go a little in front!
A respectful company or without barriers is a thing, but when the moment arrive in which eminent sportsmen arise, artists, actors, political or lawyers, will begin to change all truly.
Up to now, are cut off from cases people that have a great force of will.
The group The Tap Tap is at present very popular, but if we look at some years ago, ¿what carried you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as the educator in ústav, where had many young people to my around that wanted to be dedicated to something.
And since I am a musician, I touch, among others, the saxophone, I founded a group amateur with a coworker.
And with time, like ours he says moderating was itself us a little the hands (laughters).
Nevertheless, the popularity did not arrive to these last years, ¿or I mistake me?
It is true that helped us enough the fact to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that itself is not seen, is as if not to exist.
Thanks to the aids of the European Union, we can permit us besides faculty of quality, equipment, etc.
You intended to arrive so far away with The Tap Tap?
Since the principle I saw the potential that there was, that something can be done of another way.
The show business is full of things that seem the some to the other.
It is logical, to its way, all the new thing is received with caution and delays a lot of time in being accepted.
There is few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone that sees us for the first time is clearly the compassion, is a natural reaction...
But the compassion is completely superfluous because the people with disability are not beings abandoned that suffer and of the ones that we should we have compassion.
There is people that is capable of living a full life and to be developed, with the condition, of course, that have the necessary media.
I always say that if something turns out well people with disability, then, is not only an advance for them, but for all the company.
It helped the fact that are you an exacting leader, as describes him many people?
If we want to do a work of quality, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and to require certain discipline.
I believe that is completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when they are informed that two days have to respond to practice, to go to the test prep school and to spend a lot of time travelling and in concerts, the initial elation abandons them quickly.
But thus it is how functions everywhere, in each group that wants to work and to obtain something.
At present the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the starts of the year 1998?
Only one: .
We are an open group, the people enters and leaves, itself cannot be avoided.
Who have will and desires will find always the open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock
Will take place in the Incheba Sand of Prague, in Fléda of Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and they will participate 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected in the end of the evening through videoconference to sing jointly the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The objective of the concert is to meet the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational center without barriers STUDEO in ústav of Prague, whose price elevates to 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and the children to 12 years have entrance free in the option of sale anticipated in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
In the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Spatial Agency celebrated last week was accepted to Poland as twelfth member of the THAT. Is the second member country of the THAT of the old block of Europe of the east, after the Czech Republic, that became member full November 12, 2008).
Poland initiated an intense contribution with the THAT in the year 1994 and during the subsequent years participated in the commission of projects of the agency.
Nevertheless, the road of Poland toward the cosmos began long before.
The Polish enthusiasts already were dedicated to the flights to the space before World War Two, although not always its work was understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld in the astronomical observatory of Warsaw in which, December 6, 1933, presented its ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to the cosmonáutica".
The ideas of the young engineer (born the 1905) left the indifferent assistants and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that the Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the unique one that had shown interest in its work.
In the year 1934 Šternfeld obtained in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch by its "Introduction to the cosmonáutica".
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned previously, was converted later in a great driving force of the astronomy and of the cosmonáutica.
It published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a developer of the cosmonáutica, was known everywhere and its contribution to the science was seen rewarded when was put its name to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was going to be supplies of a motor of rockets.
Sadly, who does not know themselves was the author of the proposal and neither the destalles of the project are known.
It is not clear if the rocket went to to be utilized for the starter of the dresina or for its braking.
The information on this dresina is limited to it collected in the press of the epoch.
From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to be dedicated to the missiles.
The investigation was financed by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in contribution with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material conserved, is done evident that the investigation arrived at the stadium of the practical tests.
Nevertheless, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In the year 1937 appeared in the press specialized the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were destined to the military use of the motors for missiles.
Little before the war, the Committee provisional scientific advisor (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) took charge of all the missiles techniques projects for military use and coordinated all the works.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was seen interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies dedicated to the cosmonáutica appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks at work of the Polish Company of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the edition of November from 1954 of the magazine Problemy refers for the first time to the company with four very extensive articles dedicated to the astronautics.
In one of them, of the prof. M. Subotowicze, the creation of a company was proposed that would be dedicated to the cosmonáutica.
In that epoch already they had itself placed in motion projects of artificial satellites and was obvious that the cosmic investigation was a discipline with perspectives of future.
From principles from 1956 the Polish Company of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to form part of the International Confederacy of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in autumn of that same year the PTA became member full.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), passed to be the vice president of the International Confederacy of Astronautics.
It performed this charge to its death in 1959.
From the 1956, the PTA participated in a significant way in the development of the rocket probes RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), that was a success and became the first rocket Polish in which scientific investigation was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was finalized in 1957 and October 10, 1958 was launched for the first time.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, some 80 cm of length and did not arrive at the 5 kg of weight.
Later, it was finished to build the version RM-1A and in summer of 1959 the air tests of the rockets were initiated RM-2 of two phases in the desert of.
The rocket mediates 1.4 meters and weighed some 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was going to be object of real scientific study. The rocket RM-34 was going to have a height of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of height.
Nevertheless, in 1962 the works were suspended.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was the rocket Meteor-1, that was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed like rocket of two phases, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
They developed three types (calls Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), that were differentiated among itself by the available space for the scientific apparatuses.
In the rocket Meteor-1A the available space for the volume was of 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum height in the three types was of 37 km.
Between the years 1965 and 1968 developed in the Air Institute the rocket Meteor-2, whose first air tests were initiated in October of 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying an useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km of height.
Subsequently the version was built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is necessary to mention also the entrance of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In the framework of the program Interkosmos, Poland joined with the investigation of the cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in the year 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social works is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law traabajos social.
The resolution awoke a heated discussion in the company.
Of course will be interesting to examine the existing problems since a more extensive point of view.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, the same as in the world globalized, they are based on the principle of a greater economic competence and less regulatory.
Consequently, this signifies that the different economic forms and the national economic systems are in permanent conflict among itself.
The cause is found in the principle of the free commerce and of the movement free and unlimited of private capital, along with the wild financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in the labor price (of the salaries) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importing of cheap merchandise, tries to shorten distances and for it "causes a bajadda" of the price of the competitor with the objective to be done with most of the market and, in this way, to enlarge its profit margin.
To great scale signifies, for the majority of the businessmen, to transfer the production to the foreigner, to buy there more cheap or well to disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries in which the price of the work, in comparison with other economies, is higher.
Due to that the private capital does not have social responsibility some and, with it, is neither responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expense of the state grows necessarily.
All this situation favors the total disinterest of the businessmen by paying taxes and to compensate the social and economic damages that have caused in its eagerness of obtaining benefits.
The situation is universally so known that is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
The scrupulous little practices of the private capital create situations, in you determined economies, in which the governments of said countries are seen obliged to compete with the objective to reduce artificially the social level of the own population and, in this way, to attract foreign capital to the country.
They said otherwise, the governments put private capital at the disposal of its own population without keep in mind the social slope.
This it is done patent above all in the changes of the laws in force.
The objective is to oblige the population to that accept the dictation of the private capital, above all as for the salaries.
This takes place, on the one hand, by means of the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; by another, by means of the right restricted of the employees as for labor rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with the increase of the differences between poor and rich.
For a series of years, they exist in Germany food delivery points for poor people that cannot be maintained with their own work.
The number of people that receive this type of aid arrives already to the million.
In the framework of the increment of the competitiveness of the German economy, a quite frequent case is produced: employed people with a so low salary that the state should pay the remainder to arrive at the indispensable minimum for survive.
Public a scandal of this type related to the situation of the employees was make you help of the German federal parliament.
The measures of savings of practically all the southern states of the EU conduct, without place to doubts, to the same situation. The people, pressured by a vast slope of its social level, they are seen obliged to emigrate like in the 19th century or to struggle with a very bad salary in the limit of the company, with the hope that some day arrive at the country capital private investor.
Is necessary preguntrarse from where comes?
In the case that be a matter of other countries of the EU, then the poverty passes from a country to another or does not arrive never, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or Africans continue working for a negligible part of a European salary.
This also it affects to every Latin America.
The liberal theories and the mass media affirm to the satiety that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that to direct the economy conducts to its failure.
The private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy being interfered in the control.
Subsequently, it is necessary to be asked if the private capital does not influence with its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, in all the state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all the states.
The result is a desperate situation that is declared in the environment of the corruption, in the mutual favors, in a legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is the following one: the state departments, for lack of financial media, they entrust the editing of government bills to private legal businesses, which are often linked with the industry.
This type of government bills they are approved later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all the power does not emanate of the town, just as is announced in the constitutions of the western democracies, but of the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that the democracies with a liberal orientation be found quickly in a situation how the one that describes Appiános in their work The crisis of the Roman republic in times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state carried time being disintegrated and the administrations were occupied by force".
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and aid to finance stones or swords.
The bribe and the corruption extended without any impediment and the people responded to the ballot boxes with the vote agreed beforehand"... "There was not people with character that aspired to a position in the administration, so once, on account of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began be talk seriously that the only remedy for a so serious situation was the autocracy and that was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appiános thought about Pompeii, Caesar rose to the power and he transformed the democracy for always in autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way that in the antiquity, is that the current company is based on inconsiderate preferences of the individual benefit without keep in mind the common interests.
The private capital is not capable, in its essence, to understand and to demand the benefits of all the company.
The result is the same one that that of then, a decadence of the unprecedented elite, without an effort be carried out to reform it in depth.
The causes of the boom of the fascist states and communists should be sought, therefore, in the wild liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th century and XX.
With respect to the current situation, is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a democracy of liberal type, as a definite pause, to the wait of the next blow.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite ignores completely the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, humane and social catastrophes of the ones that have been witnesses, as well as the crimes against the humanity, just as we know them in the ancient history and the most recent one.
The suspension of the law on public awarding is not the solution; at least not long-term.
Low pressure of the so much, economic competence to international level as inside the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be seen obliged to continue seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This tendency is, therefore, sistémica.
The solution passes for concrete sociopolitical reforms, that reinforce so much the participation of the capital of the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and that they weaken the position of monopoly of the private capital in the company for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of the chaos.
"That nothing you eat from violence and nothing ever could" (arises anything of the violence and nothing would be able to do it), Sting in its song Fragile and whose refrain prays "Let' s gave not forget how fragile we till" (do not we forget us of the fragile thing that we are).
"If my children did not want wars, do not there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in their bed of death in the year 1849.
After the last waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, they have arisen, as usual, diverse reactions.
A, of the side of Israel, argues in favor of the right of self-defense and classes the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other it supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Arabs Palestinian and defect to Israel of terrorist state.
I do not want to center me in who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. When all is said and done, the citizens of nowadays of Israel, included the autonomous territories, they were born inside the current political situation and not the starts of the violence lived.
My intention is to offer the readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who removes benefit of the tensions that are dragged since 95 years ago (calculated from the statement Balfour in November of 1917) in a small surface of land of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations they are based on historic events, other in conclusions to the ones that I have arrived on the base of my own way to understand the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driving force of the events of the modern history.
In the history of the humanity the history of the fights by the power is in the first row.
In each epoch we can find an Alejandro Great or a Napoleon.
But what no longer is so evident is if were always these personages the ones that directed their steps in an autonomous way or if behind their throne there was someone that oriented their actions toward a determined objective.
We should accept that we live in an epoch that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, itself has not been able to arrive in a single generation.
From among these astronomically rich families emphasizes a that would be able to be considered the most prominent one (if still there is someone behind, him do not I know, but do not I rule out him) : the Rothschild.
Himself he is not written a lot to near them.
Naturally.
In the years 90 of the 19th century they bought the first agency of news (Reuters) so that to stopped associating their name with criminal acts of a lot of gravity. The power and the wealth, or both, the backs they covered them, thing that for them always signified a strengthening.
They have important participations in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, has been declared or a war is being prepared: before the attack to Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq they were 5, after ousting to Gadafi only they remained four, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to be opposed this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the War of Secession to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the system of federal reserve (FED) and was murdered in 1963; the congressperson Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after wanted to demand to the FED by to have unchained the great economic crisis of the year 1929.
Its eagerness by the world power carried during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33.
The first war was marked like objective to eliminate the large monarchical states in every Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third one was proposed to reduce the population of the land between half million and billion people (similar quantity of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and they would not consume so many resources), besides the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenism not Is nothing but a draft for similar solution) and the final adoption of the absolute powers.
The method with the one that operates the group of the richest families, along with the Rothschild, continues the dynamics of the unleashing of crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab I fall - order from the chaos).
These solutions are, nevertheless, erroneous, and they involve always a deterioration of the situation. If not, it suffices to recall that the FED was created so that be not to repeated a crisis as that of the year 1907.
So, after the success of the murder of the heir to the austro-hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after, because of it, the First World War unchained themselves, they destroyed the Russia czarist with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War had just sudden and unwarranted way since the economic and military point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to put an end to the Russia czarist were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Europe Central, the Austro-hungarian empire.
To pave the way of World War Two, they permitted that the bankers and politicians created, of way concealed, a troubled situation because of the enormous repairs of imposed war on Germany, with what the optimum conditions for the radicalization of the masses impoverished were created. Subsequently, it sufficed with service to the Germans the solution of the Führer, that was it sufficient strong and simple and indicated to guilty, and to build later a Czechoslovakia composed by several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, that turned on the flame and caused the crash of the war.
In the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild prompted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the old one Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to the Zion).
The statement Balfour mentioned previously sat down the bases for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arabian population of the place.
They were produced attack terrorist in both parts.
World War Two exploded: is difficult to know if Hitler threw too much of the cord to which they had it tied the international bankers at first or if everything that caused formed part of a plan. Nevertheless, the suffering of the European Jews in the fields of concentration created the optimum conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world company.
Israel was founded officially in 1948 and, of similar way to the way in which the repairs of imposed war to Germany leveled the road toward World War Two, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If the international bankers to manage to initiate it, the Jewish nation, just like in World War Two, would become victim in the first line of battle, now along with the Arabian population or, generally, Moslem of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only in the framework of its country, but also to international scale. We take as an example how they are divided of unequivocal way the supporters and critics of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where the injustice engenders injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if to the start of all was the greed of some individuals and its eagerness by the world power?
On this point is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their proxies, because, just like happens in our country, the alone international bankers present their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of loyal, fascist politician to the international bankers, that does everything possible to declare the war to Iran and, considering that Iran is member of the Organization of Cooperation of Shanghai (Chinese, India, Russia, Pakistan. ..), would threaten in be become a conflict global and, if we keep in mind that Iran controls the strait of Ormuz, by where passes the 20% of all the world petroleum (the Runner of navigation has only two miles of wide), would carry to the destruction of the world economy.
Low what light the words are shown now that pronounced David Rockefeller in 1994: "The unique thing that need is a general crisis and the people will be according to a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the remainder of the population serves to a handful of people that form part of the financial aristocracy well accommodated.
A world in which to each new individual is established him a chip upon being born that controls all its to be.
"And it obliges all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or in the front, to be not able to buy neither to sell, to be not that they carry the name of this monster or the figures of their name.
It is necessary to understand it: who have two forward fingers, that plunges the numbers of this monster.
The number mark to the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six".
Movie Argon: If crude oil is put, call to Hollywood
In November of 1979 a group of the demonstration of pro-islamic students occupied the American embassy in Teheran and took 52 graduates as the hostages.
Its it put at liberty was going to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution fled to United States, country that had sponsored its state during decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive perspective: to throw the shah by the gunwale could not be permitted it, since, if did it, endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But it it put at liberty of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had flowed into in the constitution of the theocratic state, was not within its reach.
Was a blow to the prestige of the United States, that subsequently intensified still more with the failed intent to free the hostages by the force.
The diplomats imprisoned were freed 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the government of Algeria.
In United States, its destiny caused a wave of solidarity and animadversión against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed in a decisive way to the rout of Jimmy Carter front Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980.
The movie "Argon" of the director and actor Ben Affleck tematiza an episode of this history, that harvested a small success for America.
Little before occupying the embassy, they escaped six employees of the building.
After a complicated voyage, they finished in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in contribution with the Canadian authorities, managed to remove them of Iran, for it helped a concealed history an extravagant point: you left with Canadian passports, like members of the film team that examined the locating in the country for the filming of an overproduction of science fiction.
Combination of kinds
The plan that drew the expert in "exfiltración" Toni Mendez required the contribution of Hollywood.
So that the lie to seem truthful, he was written on the film project in magazines specialized, press conferences were organized, the company of fictitious production had even one real office.
The details on the operation were maintained in secret for a long time, the movie has done itself from the memories of Tony Mendez.
The movie of Affleck is a singular combination of various kinds.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; by another, a call "caper movie", the history of an episode that turned out well, a deceit (an example can be the series Ocean' s Elevate).
In the movie they combine the states of spirit. We find on the one hand sequences well documented of Teheran. In the sequence of credits symbolic photographs of the epoch of the events are shown, that were expressed in the same way in the movie; there is not many differences to this respect.
By the other, typical scenes of Hollywood a the more light, marked by the irony and a light exaggeration.
And besides, scenes of the head office of the CIA and other institutions: men dressed that analyze the situation in the negotiating table, in the walkways of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to resume its career of an excellent way.
The actor, that had been object of mockeries, has become a director respectable and its way to act has left to be the white one of ironic comments.
Argon is its third feature film, after "small Good-bye, Good-bye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, is the first movie of Affleck in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where was raised.
Likewise, the sensibility to grasp the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that situated the directors of old movies above standards of Hollywood.
And Affleck shows it in Argon, where Teheran itself "wheel" in Canada.
The better scenes of the movie take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of it takes of the embassy is impressive by its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, trasmite the emotion of the confusion and of the lack of forecast that arises when, in some place, the history takes a step ahead.
Affleck and its collaborators obtain a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the team impostor in the bazaar of Teheran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a history explained does not offer a lot in the film sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it is fixed them well enough. At times adds something to the reality: here does not leave all of so elegant way (the scene in which awaits the crisis in the airport of Teheran, the deviation of a call to America and the wild search after its trail become an insanity).
The weakness of Argon is the chaos that arises of the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as the collaborators of Hollywood, although its personages deserved more space and they are not, neither much less, the unique in this film.
By these motives, the movie of Affleck loses a little dramatic line, but is a film that can continue with an interest moderate, to value its execution and the reactionary style of a thriller that evokes the years 70.
But that itself cave-in, that will be difficult.
As evocation of a real history and as test of the exaggerated thing that can be the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services, is sufficient.
Rules for the inflated of globes, bananas and circus
The servant www.bankovnipoplatky.com, that each year presents a survey on the most absurd banking rates, now has determined to announce the contest on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the workshop of the EU".
"It occurred itself us after the last event, the EU anticipates to approve a 40 percent quota of women in positions of direction in the large European businesses", explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify the insurance policies between men and women.
Up to now, the women surpassed of better prices in the insurances of life because they represent objectively a smaller risk.
"Other incredible ideas of the workshop of the EU can be proposals by the people until the end of this year".
The election will take place to end of the month of February of 2013", reported Nacher.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligatory addition of biocomponentes to the fuel that, as a consequence, damages the environment; another prohibition is the utilization of the thermometers of mercury of all the life only because they contain a small quantity of a dangerous substance or the guideline sombre the size of the cages of the chickens, that has contributed to the considerable increment of the price of the eggs This year.
The factual prohibition has been criticized to utilize the expression "butter to grease" or the withdrawal of the classical lightbulb of the commerce.
A banana of quality should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The apparatus of the Union takes this type of decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are defended normally by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that the bananas of greater quality should have in the EU a length of at least 14 centimeters and they could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended themselves saying that with this only seeks to harmonize the national norms done not homogenize to date, that only they complicated their commercialization.
The norms that refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, in spite of the opposition of some states, they smooth out itself on the base that the existing board of directors involves a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the EU of last year according to which in the inflatable globes that market is obligatory to notify that the children less than 8 years are not authorized to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study according to which, when is spoken of toys, the globes are the main cause of childlike death by asphyxiation.
Is also in force an applicable similar restriction to the use of party crasher on the part of children of to 14 years.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Likewise absurd it is the referring regulation to the European officials: everyone who have some official function in the EU cannot utilize the denomination of fruit Salad. For wound not the sensibility of Greece, should be spoken of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of fruit Salad).
The servant Bankovnípoplatky.com, in contribution with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned further up, the prescription of the Union on the volume of the provisions of food in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of provisions of food that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic the same day of our entrance to the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic surpassed, for example, the volume established for mushrooms in preserve, what a threat of substantial fine supposed him.
To the organizers of the survey also interested the occurrence to pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea to offer a subsidy for the request of subsidies.
This class of ideas did not they arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are in disadvantage by the circumstance of have not sea.
We request to the European Union a clearing", declared in autumn from the 2004 the then minister of agriculture Jaroslav Spades.
It argued it with the fact that in our country was produced a lot of cereal and, as a result of the calls intervention purchases, the state had the full stores and had to export itself.
According to Spades, given that the Czech Republic is far from the maritime ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euro.
In the end, the European Commission was shown willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public contest for the purchase of the cereal of the countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to receive a subsidy was proposal to the municipalities by the department for the local development directed by the minister Pavel (US-DEU). Concretely, it is destined to the subsidies requests editing of Brussels.
EU: The rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the member states are often white of criticisms, the efforts of the EU in matter of regulations and, likewise, an operation and development more troops in all the Union deserve more well, according to various experts, our recognition.
According to the experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of subsidies of the EU for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of the European integration, but that the member states have obtained in the negotiations on budgets.
To the Czechs also touches the sensitive fiber, in the same way that to other countries of the Union, the fight by the right to the denomination of origin of its traditional products, although our country always have not left victorious of these fights.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrian, they defended with success the denomination of origin of the cottage cheese of Olomouc, but they had to change him the name to the ron national, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and passed to be called "tuzemák".
Only the elaborate products from the distilled of cane of sugar can be called ron, but not those sugar beet facts.
In the official listing of denominations of origin protected of the EU, along with the cheeses fetus and gorgonzola known everywhere, the marzipan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, already they are found for example the crackers of Karlovy Vary, the tent of and of and, even, the variety of hop of.
As crystal balls protected of the EU, they will be able to be proud from the the bread of ginger of Pardubice and the cones of v Podkrkonoší.
The people wants that save the republic, but I am a fan, affirms Okamura
Mister senator, ¿how occurred to be presented to the elections for president?
Does not be a matter of being a senator or president.
If in our country was all well, then would not present my candidacy.
But no longer I can bear to see how is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how the thieves remain unpunished, they enlarge the taxes and the retirement age.
Did not have ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something that i do not like, intent to hit upon a solution to change it.
And since already I am forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility that have to change the things is to present me as the senator or president.
To the Senate already has arrived, but shortly after has itself placed on the way toward the presidency.
It is not giving the back to those people that have voted it?
Always I said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results in the elections of the senate.
Later I needed that if chosen senator left, he would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my objective is not the function; the function is the tool with the one that I can do reality my own ideas.
Therefore I need possible the greater influence and the mandate more strong possible.
The problem is not alone that we be a nation that criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but we trample to any that want to initiate a change.
To this the mass media they add him themselves, that discredit you and they confuse the freedom of speech with the liberty to lie.
Of me he is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor of Paroubek.
We are going to speak of its ideas.
It is presented to the presidential fight with financial thesis and penal responsibilities of politicians and the statement of the property above twenty million.
For it should change the law.
As the president does not have this competence and only the senate in its entirety can propose laws.
How does it want to resolve it?
As the citizen, I have formed part of a pressure group so that the position of guide be to recognized like autonomous work, and we obtain it.
The problem is in the politics: if someone arrives with a good proposal, whether of right or of left, he is rejected by the way and this affects the citizens.
As independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain the support of all the parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholings neither dogmas of party, I have the capacity to be able to choose something of each party that be better for our country and to apply it.
A man of right is considered more well or of left?
Since the Czech point of view, I have the impression that the people considers me more than left.
For me does not have importance, whether a little left or a little right.
What imports is me that we do well.
It does not matter to me if someone is of right or of left, I want to join with the people.
Always support openly any good solution, independently of if the proposal comes from the or of the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
It does joke when is said of you that is populist.
But it it is not showing with what says?
When a business plan for the business is created, you have also certain objectives and ideal.
And you try to approach they.
There it will be who call it populism, but all the proposals of the ones that speak already function in the world or expert acquaintances speak of them.
But without the support of the parliament only orders remain him.
And with it it cannot survive in the long-term politics.
Or believe you that if is directed to the people and speech with them, will obtain, for example, a financial and penal responsibility?
I do not have another option.
Convincing politicians, to journalists and to the civil company and to try to put them of my part to obtain it.
If they to be elected president, do not there would be problem in organizing a broadcast in direct by television in which would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties that legitimized the penal responsibility and financier for politicians, officials, judges and public prosecutors of the state.
And, eventually, they would have that to communicate reason do not they desire it.
If there is a strong personage that indicates the disputes, pressure in the political scene can be done.
We take for case the direct election of the president, that has been an achievement of the public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that only I am a fan, I am not neither a genius neither an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideal I try to seek allies.
I have just begun in the politics and intent to obtain the major possible support for my program.
I try to remove the things ahead i, but in the event that do not turn out well, inside six years I will leave him and I will return to the private sector.
It sounds a little as if Okamura went to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that with a person I do not do anything, therefore I have visited to a series of known personalities, by if maybe they were encouraged to present their candidacy to the senate.
I went to see Radim but was denied because had a lot of work.
By my part, at least I have supported the journalist of investigation Janus Lorencová, that removed to the light the frauds with light oils of heating.
I presented me leaving from the base that the people is really dissatisfied, now I am in the scale.
The sixty percent of the population did not respond to the ballot boxes and, those that did it, they voted the representatives of the establishment.
In the senate we are two of the independent sector.
The people chose the senate, of such way that will be complicated to achieve changes.
Nevertheless, I will defend my own ideas, as for example the direct election of mayors or of governors.
It is considering to form its own party?
Not yet I have considered it because I do not have time for it, to verify the irreproachable past of each one of the member potentials of the party, neither do neither I have money.
I do not have money neither for the campaign to the presidency, in my transparent account only there are 20,000 crowns.
Does not have money?
It speaks of statements of the property, ¿how is his?
I reckon my private property in some 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued in 25 million, a flat valued ten million, another flat limited in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of some 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued in a million, and in the account I have a pair of millions.
Certainly, I have an Aston Martin because was my dream of youth. Always i liked James Bond, that conducted this car, was gallant with the women and, at the same time, fought against the wickednesses and injustices.
It conducts an Aston Martin, its property is valued in 60 million and does not have money for the campaign?
You say that wants to change the republic but does not want to put too much money of its part.
Is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
I have to get into debt?
In the campaign already I have placed 2.5 million.
The fact that have no sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my program.
And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money of my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign cover in essence what I will receive in senator salary concept.
But would not be able to live on it. For example, would not be able to pay him my son the English school, that costs 30,000 monthly crowns.
If he wanted only to win money, then me he would not present as the candidate.
So will continue with its business activity to be able to live?
It has not said before that was going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a greater salary.
As I have promised, in part I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will pass to be my replacement in spring.
The people would want that was the Samaritan that saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much it is accustomed to win monthly as the businessman?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, that continue winning.
If it was a president, then he would leave the business.
It can consult all the interview in the edition on Saturday of Práva.
The study of architecture MVRDV shows that the true not alone adventures are in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the recently finished "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I believe that the building is amused, has a futuristic aspect, and at last there is somewhat interesting that to see", affirms Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by that passes along the street.
And Stefan Spermon, technician of YOU in a great business situated near the library, aims: "Besides, the building is pretty".
But I ask me why do we need a library nowadays.
All we have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
Nobody enters for flavor in those out of date libraries, ¿not?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom community situated to the doors of Róterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, shows off the doubtful honor to to have raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants presents the rate of teaching literacy more drop of the Netherlands.
To counteract this so shameful situation, does some years was decided to contribute of some way to the general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented in the bills of euro in the shape of miniatures of reinforced concrete decorated.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And thus it was like the political heads decided that alone a possibility existed to improve the statistics: There was that to build a library!
Winy Maas, of the study of Dutch architecture MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of the bar charts and responsible for amusing buildings at par that cynical, the theme with its habitual serenity was taken and appeared to the presentation of the contest in the year 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face.
And while the jury looked at puzzled around him and shrank of shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded its brief speech with the following words: "They reckoned fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, it called `Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euro raises itself in the place predicted.
This forms part of the project of revitalization, that itself complete with a subterranean parking, a supermarket, a post office and a dwellings buildings pair and semidetached.
At the beginning from November the mountain of books was a prizewinner with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
Besides, the project also is nominated to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small lacking city of history, that to date did not have nothing but to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly City Hall after whose white facade one would sense more well a central milk jug, account now with a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse arranges now of the first building cultural public of its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that is a matter of a paradise of books under a cheese dish.
Well it is certain that there is an elevator that transports us just to the center of this solid mountainous one, but the true lovers of the space and the reading do not utilize it, but they prefer to be melted with their topography at every step of their escalation to the top.
The interior completely glazed turns out to be luminous and easy to cover with the view, the floor of brick heated and the elegant streetlights support of unmistakable form the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Upon raising the view they can come the banks of the park they visualize, the dogs and the children and girls playing the soccer.
And on all sides books, books and more books.
"Normally the bookcases of books are arranged along the facade and in the center an enormous dark room is opened that, generally, is used to being somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal", affirms Winy Maas.
What we have done we is to put up the legs the classical spatial configuration and to remove the zone of reading of the interior to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage of: in the middle the offices they are found, the library of Internet, the club of chess, the center of environmental education and the room of maintenance.
Special mention they deserve the black bookcases that assume the functions of mural covering, parapet and banister at the same time.
The view, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even the architects and the civil engineers more to the day shake the head when they hear to speak of this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with materials recycled", explains us Joop Trouborst, leader of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And thus is like a day, in an agricultural exploitation Friesland, we come upon the adequate byproduct originating in the agriculture.
Since many years ago, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands a plastic weaving of scarce millimeters is utilized in thickness as base to hold the roots of the cultivations.
Is a matter of an efficient and cheap material.
This hard fine weaving two stations and later itself waste.
For the library this weaving was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until obtaining plates of four centimeters in thickness.
With the heat and the pressure, the called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes of color and becomes a material dark, homogeneous and resistant that smells of a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps arrives at the top of the mountain.
In the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain the reward awaits us: since the not alone café has a fantastic view of the city, but in her also some can enjoy itself tasty Dutch croquettes and its rubber plant planted in enormous flowerpots.
These they create a pleasant environment at par that maintain the adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it cost to believe it given its large surfaces glazed, this building is an exemplary project as for the ecology", indicates Trouborst.
The heating and the necessary cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
In spite of the fact that the mountain of books is situated under an enormous pyramid of crystal, even in the sunniest days the alone sun shines during few hours in its interior.
The enormous cerchas of wood situated in cross sense to the facade of crystal serve to give shadow and they absorb the majority of the rays of the sun.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The remainder is thing of the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the industrious skeptic of the sector of the information technologies, already has dared to put the foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Likewise, the teacher of Chinese traditional medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, because of the inauguration that took place does a pair of weeks, was invited to all the inhabitants from the city to donate a book of its private collection.
In this way intends to fill, for the time being, the optic holes of a library that not yet counts on its complete file; currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has penetrated depth.
The bookcases are full.
"There it is nothing worse than an empty medium library", affirms the architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
All they know that its book forms part of the library.
Although alone it be there to adorn.
In this way, the study MVRDV has obtained all a success in that discipline reign that in the slang specialized is known like "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of the literature.
Independently of the young thing and uncultured that can be.
At last a starting point to conform its identity.
Szabo: "The Germans should play a role more protagonist"
Germany has abstained in the voting on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in the relations States. UNITED. -Europe, this situates to Berlin in a quite tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of week, Germany gave understand that would vote against the proposal to grant to the Palestinian territories the observer State condition of the United Nations.
Nevertheless, finally Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now well, due to the special relation that joins with the country with Israel, Germany should be careful.
But at the same time I believe that does neither support the American position.
Germany wanted to show its independence without being too much criticism with Israel.
During the lifting that took place in Libya in March of 2011, Germany also abstained when of what treated was to establish a flight prohibition zone.
This has been declared finally by the NATO.
It turns out to be difficult to Germany to adopt a clear position when they are in play fear international important?
Yes, thus is.
This itself due to that in these moments is reorienting its foreign policy, being moved away of a politics headed, by thus tell it, by the United States and being centered in a German foreign policy.
And what complicates still more the things is that the Europeans do not have a uniform and coherent politics.
Therefore, the Germans are found in a crossroads.
Of them it is expected that they perform a more independent role, but they are not usual to do it.
I believe that still they are tanteando which will be its role, but already they have initiated the road toward a foreign policy "normal".
A similar foreign policy to the countries as France or Great Britain.
What signifies concretely a foreign policy "normal" since the German point of view?
It is a politics that, when is a matter of national interests, is shown willing to defend different positions to those of United States or its European associates.
I believe that the German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in the economic politics, that is to say, in the exports and in their relations with you determined regions, like they can be Russia, Chinese or Next East.
The German economic interests are up to a point different to the of other large powers and for that reason Germany should protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced in the position adopted with regard to the conflict in Next East and in the voting of the UN?
On the one hand, Germany counts on large markets in Next East, especially in the Gulf.
For that reason should be careful and not to be alienated of the Arabian public opinion neither neither of the Arabian elites.
This is important, of course.
But I not so much importance would give him since does not be a matter of a completely unilateral relation.
Nevertheless, yes they play a fundamental role in the German considerations.
It has undermined Germany its relation with States. UNITED. upon being abstained of voting in important decisions as in the voting on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of comprehension.
For that reason, I do not believe that have itself produced a break as drastic as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with it Germany have managed to earn a certain respect.
When all is said and done, all this has not done but to show that is a country to which they take in serious as whose and international actor interests one must keep in mind.
In Europe different opinions about the Palestinian initiative exist.
On the other hand, States. UNITED. it has been shown clearly in favor of a veto.
Disparity of opinions among States exists. UNITED. and many European nations?
Always these disparities due to the American domestic policy have existed.
I believe that the government of Obama sample in secret a great comprehension toward the European position.
But, on account of the political situation that lives itself here, he is evident that the government cannot defend in public that position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not have in reality the importance that him is attributed.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and the Israeli prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is for keen nothing on the politics that develops.
It turns out to be difficult to Germany to reconcile the narrow relations that maintains with Israel and United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main associates in the EU, by another?
I believe that is exactly that what does that be so difficult for the Germans.
Of course that would be a little easier for the Germans if to exist a coherent European politics and homogeneous, but is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to form part of an upper entity, but they should prompt the things since their own position.
That is exactly what are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future one Germany will assume a role of leadership at the moment of to oblige Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course that this is nothing easy for Germany, whether simply by the relation that maintains with Israel.
This has been always a tricky theme.
But I believe that the Germans have of course they should perform the role of independent figure.
Germany to itself in the role of is seen important international actor? It desires in reality Germany to assume a role protagonist?
Or perhaps it continues him turning out to be difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany not yet has accustomed, always results somewhat uncomfortable and, by evident motives, to the country continues him costing to play a more important role.
If we observe the crisis of the euro, for example, we see that each time that Germany is positioned like main actor, certain feelings are untied antialemanes.
This does not turn out to be easy for the Germans.
It is a matter of an old problem and the fact is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
It seen in this way, Germany is found in an a lot more difficult position than United States.
It should show a receptive attitude set against the different neighbors and opinions and that does not turn out to be easy.
The influence of States. UNITED. in the European politics diminishes each time more, but the EU does not cover with moment that empty one, ¿who remains then?
To the Germans not remedy will remain them more than assuming a role more protagonist.
Even if he does not like, if turns out to be unpleasant them or if becomes a town them still more unpopular, c' est the vie!
Stephen Szabo is Executive Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academic and experts in politics originating in Europe and of North America analyze of joint form the challenges to the ones that the transatlantic community is faced.

"Protection of marks" in China: when Puma and Armani they are converted suddenly in Chinese marks
Armani is a known mark on a worldwide basis and Pole Ralph Lauren also.
But, ¿what is Armani Pole?
After this name hides a registered denomination officially in China but that has nothing to do with the original businesses.
Nevertheless, this enjoys protection while the true epónimos do not feel a demand.
And even then it is not of course be going to give them itself the reason.
"To the foreigners results them increasingly more difficult to protect its marks in China", indicates Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the law practice Taylor Wessing specialized in protection rights violations in Far East.
Each week arrives at my table a new case.
The imitators simply add a pair of letters to be able to register its marks.
In this way, Gucci itself becomes-Lu Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
The German businesses also are copied legally in the same way, just as the article-maker has occurred sports Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which keeps seats of the office of marks of Beijing.
September 14, 2010 a Chinese business requested to register the mark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also was served of the fashionable house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in that to copy and to violate the rights of copyright is to spare known.
In the large cities large stores of several plants dedicated exist exclusively for sale of forgeries.
Nevertheless, the cases of Pattloch are of another kind. By assignment of its clients, he fights against the fact that the office of marks grant of official form to the Chinese businesses the right to remove benefit of a denomination that already is registered in another place.
The Chinese call him "Bang Ming Pie" or marks companion.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
That refers to women that have "fish" to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It is damaging for the business, one must fight against it", requires Pattloch.
"The mark does water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage that suffers the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the legal coasts of the sectors affected are millionaires, above all in the case of symbolic products of luxury.
According to data of the market analysis business CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million euro to the Chinese year is, in size, the third market of luxury items and the one that grows to greater rhythm.
Nevertheless, to achieve the annulment of inscriptions of doubtful legality in the registration of marks turns out to be complicated and besides supposes a lot of money.
The processes can be prolonged to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court rejected a demand because had elapsed so much time that the name object of the demand already had become a "reality of market".
"If the plaintiff has evil luck, perhaps even he have that to pay money to the plagiador because the process has damaged to the mark of this in China", indicates Pattloch.
From time to time this is the law of the forest.
Some of the best-known cases they have to they do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a suit against the machinery-maker of construction Sany, the business that has been absorbed does little by the German manufacturer of bombs of concrete Putzmeister.
Therefore to day of today the Chinese can continue utilizing a very similar emblem to the star of Mercy.
The buyer of I Return, Geely, utilized at the beginning a blue and blank logo that recalled in great measure to BMW; the matter was resolved in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
The clothes-maker Lacoste lost in China against imitators originating in Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking at in the direction opposed to the original one.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The office of marks CTMO in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and endowment of personnel.
Last year, nevertheless, "the situation of labor emergency returned to the normality".
In this way, the claim processes quantity without dealing with has been reduced in a 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, a 75% more than the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims continue slopes of resolution.
Fighting against this costs a lot money
As is used to being habitual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million marks protection requests, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a matter of a new record and signifies that Chinese heads for tenth consecutive year the ready of new inscriptions everywhere, as indicates the office of marks.
It seems that this also occurs with the number of valid logos, figure that elevates to 5.5 million on the whole.
In 2011 they would have themselves pocketed 1,800 million yuanes in concept of rights.
They said of another form, this signifies that of average each inscription costs 1,280 yuanes or 160 euro.
Fighting against this costs a lot money, just as shows the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
Since it over seven years ago the group fight in the courts against a Chinese imitator.
Though the Germans have managed to stop the illegal production of imitation car pieces,
The imitator has managed to assure the Chinese rights on the mark Freudenberg.
"Ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected", indicates Hanno Wentzler, President and Delegated Counselor of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The office of marks CTMO also rejected the resource of the of Munich.
In the two following instances have given the reason to Freudenberg, but the contrary part continues fighting currently.
One must have a lot care
Now the case has arrived at the doors of the Upper Court of Justice, where continues slope of resolution.
Wentzler trusts in being able to resolve favorably the question and praises the professionalism of the courts.
Nevertheless, also it affirms that "the procedure is extremely costly, so much in terms of money as of time".
It turns out to be difficult to reckon the internal prices; the business file has had that to revise expedients of to a hundred years of antiquity to be able to contribute tests.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered to the contrary part a "six-digit sum in euro" with the objective to arrive at a friendly agreement, but did not be successful.
"This shows how much imports us", indicates Wentzler.
The dangers that await in Far East threaten even with affecting to Europe,
Concretely if the imitators are assured there the rights on marks done not protect.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and products of skin.
Time ago that the group abandoned this commercial environment, nevertheless managed to impede the inscription.
"One must have a lot care", affirms Wentzler.
So much he as the lawyer Pattloch recommend the German businesses that be extremely prudent at the moment of to do business with China.
Does not it suffice with trusting in the international legislation on rights of mark, but what one must cause is "to register also in China all that that can be susceptible of protection", just as aims Wentzler.
Otherwise, the theme can result a lot more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in the event that Freudenberg to lose the last robbery of its private battle, then would have that to pay to the part contrary rights of license by its own name, just as explains Wentzler.
That or in the segment in question they would expel us of the market.
World day of the fight against the AIDS: to dance, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg practices the chorus Imbongi and in Swaziland are happy the orphans of the AIDS
The history of a capable link that to surpass a lot more than 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First it begins themselves for the dance: boots of cowboy, slippers of basketball, high-heeled shoes and moccasins seek the compass on the floor of parquet, and they find it quickly.
A, two, three, four.
Alone then they begin to be elevated slowly the voices of the singers (contralto, low, state and soprano), being whirled, being hindered and being continued some to other.
And give credit Hopf, the director of 29 years, threat with being left almost of its booths upon trying to put order with its smooth and energetic gestures.
It is Monday in the afternoon and in the room of music of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi practices a new song.
Also the fifty singers have arrived, from among 23 and 69 years, since the human geneticist to the master of house.
"Om' Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the chorus has a different text and besides in a barely known foreign tongue: the Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in south Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some zones of Swaziland.
It helps for the self-help
According to an estimation of ONUSIDA, the program of the United Nations for the fight against the AIDS, everywhere 34 million people infected by the virus of the HIV exist approximately.
23.5 million they live them in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans of the AIDS.
More than the 40% of the population already is hiv-positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 orphans of the AIDS of the town of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend the secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euro monthly can be supported a boy.
This contribution will cover the registration of the school, the uniform and will guarantee a hot food to the day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi signifies in Zulu "narrator of histories" or "panegirista".
In this room nobody knows to speak with fluency this Bantu tongue, but to sing yes they know.
Since ten years ago this chorus practices songs in this smooth foreign tongue that from time to time manages to transport them to its place of origin: the south of Africa.
8,733 kilometers of distance in straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, a called town exists Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German chorus.
The forty percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, a great part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because have succumbed to the AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects to Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the hopes of life more drops of the entire world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see with good eyes the circumcision, a practice that according to has been shown reduces halfway the risk of contagion.
More than the 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are bearers of the virus of the immunodeficiency, and to die with slightly more than thirty years has become somewhat habitual.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring from 2005 the chorus discovered this hidden population, but what saw above all were many children in the streets that lacked not alone of the protection of her parents, but of the main thing: food, clothes and formation.
Without school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first was only the private commitment of a few what made possible that a boy went to the school and he enjoyed a hot food to the day. All this for a few euro.
Nevertheless, a year later the chorus founded the association "Voices for Africa" that since then has been occupied professionally of the orphans of the AIDS in Esitjeni.
Facts on the infections of sexual broadcast
Which are the main illnesses of sexual broadcast?
Among the OR of bacterial origin they are the syphilis, the clamidia and the gonorrhea.
The OR of more habitual viral origin are the AIDS, the virus of the human wart, the genital herpes or the hepatitis.
The crabs and the itch are found among the OR transmitted by parasites.
Which they are the main groups of affected?
The syphilis and the gonorrhea hit upon more frequency in men that maintain sexual relations with other men.
The Institute Robert Koch splits of the base that at least four of each five cases of registered syphilis in Germany have its origin in a sexual contact among men.
In the case of the heterosexual adults the illnesses of most habitual sexual broadcast are the infections by clamidia, tricomonas, the virus of the human wart, the candidiasis (mushroom) and the gonorrhea.
The contagion of the HIV among the heterosexual adults of the country is relatively scarce; nevertheless, approximately the 20% of the new infections by HIV they are registered in this group.
Among the youths, the infections by clamidia are a lot more habitual than in other groups of population.
According to European surveys, three rooms of all the infections affect youths from among 15 and 25 years.
In our country, the virus of the human wart also is added to the most habitual illnesses among the youth.
How has evolved the number of infections?
Not all the illnesses of sexual broadcast are you hold to obligatory statement.
According to the Institute Robert Koch, the number of infections by syphilis has doubled its figure of 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new infections by HIV maintains a descending tendency since 2007.
In 2011 2,700 cases were registered approximately.
Is a matter of a tenth splits less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that is a matter of a venereal illness?
The infectious illnesses can cause ulcers in the genital zone, inconveniences upon urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often they do not cause pain neither they cause other symptoms and therefore they are not detected.
How does it be able one to protect?
The condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer protection to the a hundred for a hundred.
Some pathogenic agents of illnesses of sexual broadcast can also be transmitted through infections by filth and by physical contact.
For that reason, the experts recommend to be submitted regularly to medical exams, above all if changes frequently of sexual couple.
If they are diagnosed of early form, the majority of the OR they can be cured and is possible to avoid any late consequence.
Through contributions, donations and, finally but not because of it less important, of the fees that charges the chorus by their actions in every Germany, they come they collect enough money.
"On the whole we have sent already some 200,000 euro to Esitjeni", indicates proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the own town Zodwa Dlamini a sure woman of itself and with gifts of leadership administers the money sent from Germany.
It is in charge of that the orphans find a good lodging, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as is called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the town.
Some of them they have to 14 orphans to their charge, they offer a ceiling where to live and they are in charge of that the children respond to the school every day promptly and you dressed with their uniforms.
The ones that do not have anyone remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a woman single woman that, just like the two cooks that take charge of cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, perceives a salary of the association.
Besides, "Voices of Africa" has placed in motion a school of dressmaking, has built two poultry coops and, in contribution with the American sanitary organization PSI, has achieved that many of the inhabitants of the town have submitted to a test of HIV.
This it is not somewhat obvious, since, in spite of the clear thing that is this illness in all the country, does not be used to speaking itself openly of her.
A king with 14 wives
"The AIDS is a taboo absolute one", affirms Annette Lennartz, "because has to do with the sexuality".
Somewhat strange in a country in which the king has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of the Africa Black, the king Mswati III, is known by its full and affluent way of life of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life done not accept officially is to a large extent responsible for the so fast propagation that has experienced the virus of the HIV in the last decades.
But also themselves due to the innumerable seasonal workers that travel through the country from a side to another and that they carry it there where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner condoms can be obtained free, but these barely they are utilized.
It is another culture, here alone they accept the contact skin against skin".
To promote the cultural exchange, the chorus Imbongi travels each two or three years by the south of Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the extreme more southerner of the African continent still recall of the epoch of the apartheid.
A full bus of white that sing songs in a language of black; so much not alone recognition brings with himself an excellent environment and a lot of happiness, but has also managed to start him a pair of tears to some that another rabid frontier soldier.
The trip carries always to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children supported.
In spite of the fact that this small population barely appears in the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is very acquaintance.
"You approach Esitjeni, there the light shines", affirms the people of the place.
And after traveling through the 8,733 kilometers in straight line of return to Heidelberg to the rooms of trial of the street Bergheimer full of singers keeping time, one realizes that is also possible to see to shine its light from there.
Messenger: The NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The probe Messenger has found tests of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the sheet of ice have a thickness of to 20 meters.
The NASA, the American spatial agency, has contributed tests of the existence of ice in Mercury.
In spite of trying the planet more close to the sun, there also there is ice water, just as is removed of three studies published Thursday in the magazine specialized "Science".
The probe Messenger would have found proof that in the zone of the planet that is found permanently in the shade a sheet of ice has been formed.
Seems that this has at least 30 centimeters and probably even to 20 meters in thickness.
The water proceeds likely of comets or, with great probability, of asteroids that in their day they collided against Mercury.
Nobody relates the find of ice with the possibility that exist life in the planet, affirms the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, they Be Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach to 426 degrees centigrade.
Nevertheless, the finds would be able to help to clear how have they arrived the water and other components of the life to other zones of the solar system.
Of completely inadvertent form for the inhabitants of the planet Land, the probes, telescopes and small robots as the Phoenix they are dedicated to explore the depths of the universe.
Occasionally they send images to the Land: small windows to the immensity of the space.
The image proceeds of a camera developed by German investigators of the Institute Max Planck.
The eight planets that conform our solar system, besides the dwarfish planet Ceres.
Just like Pluto, that revolves around the just sun behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an image of infrared taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a "portrait of family" in which stars generations infinities appear: the oldest stars are shown like blue points, although it more difficult to recognize is the color rose of the stars "newborn".
This stars formation region, called of romantic little form by the scientific W5, was discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the constellation of Casiopea, to a distance of 6,500 light years.
This iridescent image of a star in extinction was taken by the telescope Spitzer of the NASA.
The ring in the shape of doughnut is composed by the material that the star spits in its process of extinction.
In the enormous Nebula Trífida, to 5,400 light years of the Land, new stars from gas they are formed and dust.
The telescope Spitzer of the NASA took this photo of the zone of galactic stellar formation.
The Pléyades, a group of also known stars with the nickname of "The Seven Sisters", they are a visible object at first sight in the nocturnal sky.
Nevertheless, with the telescope better the colors can be appreciated.
The Nebula of the Propeller appears like an enormous red eye appears in this image of infrared.
He is found situated to 700 light years of the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity with a terrestrial continent has been worth him the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photography and an image of infrared gives rise to a spectacular color.
This star in you sift could be grasped in all its splendor for the first time by the detectors of infrared of the telescope Spitzer.
Saturn and its rings: how were originated continues being one of the large unknown quantities of the astronomy.
Probably it is a matter of remainders of one of the moons of Saturn that disappeared without leaving trace does 4,500 million years.
One of the greater and clearer photographs taken by the telescope Hubble: the Galaxy of the Swirl.
Depending on the tones, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Observatory European Southern sample the Nebula Trífida situated to various thousands of light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trífida proceeds of the latin American term "trifidus" (divided into three), since some dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this zone of stellar formation in three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco the astronomers could photograph the indications of a cosmic billiards: to 400 million light years of the Land the nuclei of two galaxies in process of fusion are thrown the one toward the other to finish colliding of hopeless form.
This formation of stars was grasped by the telescope Hubble in the spiral galaxy M83.
The ones that do not like of technical abbreviations can be referred her with the nickname of Southern Grinder.
The photography of the spatial telescope Hubble sample a section of the Nebula Iris in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula situated to 1,400 light years is composed by particles of dust whose size is between ten and a hundred smaller times than that of the particles of dust that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and of done x-rays by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes situated to 430 million light years of the Land.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment of model for the spatial telescope Hubble of the NASA.
The scientists call the spiral galaxy of greater size UGC 1810.
In this nebula the group of most brilliant young stars of our Milky Way is found.
This zone of stellar formation produces constantly new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associate to the Nebula Rosette, also they arise continuously new star; to 5,000 light years of the Land.
In this so brilliant galaxy with a small black hole still there is not dust, alone gas.
The investigators suppose that was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe hydrogen could be found above all.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei utilized it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optic telescopes has not stopped to grow and the images that offer they have us each time more depth.
For 30 years, concretely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Haul situated in the Observatory Dovecote near San Diego was the largest one of the world.
Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, States. UNITED., it raises itself the Loosen Binocular Telescope.
This permits to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each one with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Great Telescope Canaries situated in the island of The Palm is enormous - alone the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Loosen Telescope in south Africa is segmented to save prices.
Despite it, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The objection of this more economic construction is that the telescope has an angle of fixed elevation, for which its mobility is limited.
The telescope Hobby-Eberly in Tiles has also an angle of fixed elevation.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
In spite of including a diameter of said, comparatively more small mirror capacity is comparable to that of the largest telescopes of mirror of the world.
With aid of the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) the investigators can explore the universe in extraterrestrial life signs search.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search of Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI by its acronyms in English) can help any person that possess a computer, contributing capacity of prosecution.
View of the Southern European Observatory (THAT) situated in the Andes Chilean.
Here the Very raises itself Loosen Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The THAT also it will receive the called AND-ELT (European Extremely Loosen Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed by a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 does not it expect to be able to take images.
Until 2007 the two telescopes Keck situated in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were you considered the largest of the world.
These they include two mirrors, each one of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
The telescopes Keck form part of the Observatory Mauna Kea, that next to them explores the sky with the aid of the telescope Subaru and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is predicted to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a diameter of mirror of thirty meters.
This is an image of how would be.
Nevertheless, the most important information of the cosmos arrives from us the hand of the spatial telescope Hubble.
From April 24, 1990 sends images of distant worlds.
From March from 2009 the spatial telescope Kepler search planets beyond the solar system, chiefly those that are habitable.
February 2, 2011 the NASA announced that since the start of their mission 1,235 candidates to planets had been located.
In the image the last prior preparations to the launch of the spatial telescope are seen Kepler.
The telescope James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched to the space aboard a rocket Ariane 5 until 2018.
The primary mirror of this spatial telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The investigators leave from the base that in the south pole of Mercury also there is ice.
Nevertheless, they do not exist you test reliable, since the probe Messenger revolves around the planet in an orbit a lot more close to the north pole.
Since decades ago the measurements of radar aim at the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first one that orbit around Mercury, now the scientists have the certainty that is thus.
Drinking butter daily and to live 168 years
To the south of Azerbaijan many people manage to reach biblical ages.
There even one museum dedicated to the longevity exists.

A search of tracks in a country in which the people of 97 years still are you considered young.
The it traveled through by the mountainous region of Talysh would be able to be qualify as savage and romantic.
The minibús advances with great estrépito through the sinuous highway that passes next to wooded hills, rivers of great volume and of the simple houses of the local farmers.
All is green and juicy, one would be able even to think that he is found in the Black Forest.
Nevertheless, we find us in the zone more southerner of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is found to so alone some kilometers.
Here they live the "talyshi", a town of the one that themselves is not known a lot, aside from that dominate perfectly the Persian and the azerí and that are very long-lived.
Our final destiny is Lerik.
This small city presumes of an architecture perhaps too much masonite designed in it was Soviet and that does not seem to insert of the all in a so picturesque mountainous landscape.
The European tourists barely arrive at this place, since the road since the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, results too heavy.
To travel through the 323 kilometers that separate both city centers, eight hours are needed because the highway is of a single sense.
The amazing wealth of the one that enjoys the country thanks to the petroleum of the Caspian sea not yet has arrived at this hidden region.
Nevertheless, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what one must have to be become an attraction tourist.
"Baku was done famous in May because of the celebration of the Festival of Eurovision and the next year we will celebrate the Festival of the people more elders of the world", indicates Fatulayeva.
Is a matter of the director of the Museum of the Longevity, perhaps the unique one that exists in the world.
Here it is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place that have surpassed the 100 years of age. Fatulayeva indicates a black and blank image.
This is my grandfather, that lived 120 years.
An its son died at age 136
Nevertheless, the indisputable star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Müslümov, that seems to have lived 168 years.
Nevertheless, not any birth certificate exists that certify it.
And if we keep in mind that the man of greater age documented lived 122 years, he seems that the age of Müslümov is enough suspect.
"It was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", explains us Fatulayeva.
The man was married in three occasions and he had 23 children. Apparently still he had time to conceive a daughter more at age 136.
It has made a mistake itself then Müslümov in its age in a pair of decades?
Nevertheless, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist in the Institute Max Planck of Rostock, has also heard to speak of it advanced age of this inhabitant of Asia Central.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan also people of age live very advanced", affirms Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, turns out to be impossible to contribute scientific proofs about the age; especially when neither no civil registration exists.
Every day full glasses of butter melted
It is a fact that, of surprisingly frequent form, the inhabitants of the region situated around Lerik are used to reaching a biblical age.
Currently there is 20 people that surpass the 100 years of age.
Why do they live here, in the south, so many people of age advanced?
The tourist guide azerí Farid Mugimzadeh explains that is a matter of the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, the Mrs. Fatulayeva, he believes on the other hand that the cause resides in the diet.
Nevertheless, since a nutritious point of view, does not seem logical that exactly the rich diet in calories of the talyshi, that worship the meat, the bread and above all the dairy products and many of which, besides, they drink daily a glass of butter melted, be so healthy.
Or perhaps it be the form of natural life the one that maintains to the young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
To his 97 years is relatively youth for what been in fashion for these latitude.
Mirzayeva, that affirms to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple house of typical wood of all the region of the Caucasus.
Seated on the ground, moves from tireless form an enormous tub of butter.
Eight people live under a ceiling, among them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandfathers time ago.
Also they jump from a side to another two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serve in some typical glasses with form stunned.
The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and they are perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long tresses of dark blond hair that its son discovers us proud.
Always I have washed me the hair with milk, therefore never has fallen itself me and has maintained its color.
"I have neither utilized never a shampoo", affirms Mirzayeva.
The pension is sufficient to live
Same old he has eaten only what produced in his own farm: tomatoes, potatos and peas.
In all my life I have not gone never to make the purchase to a supermarket.
Then it speaks us of its husband, that was in the army.
The worse thing was the epoch after World War Two.
Nevertheless, all returned to its river bed when the "beloved father", Heydar Aliyew, took the control of the situation.
This type of publicity sounds rarely in mouth of an older woman.
Nevertheless, in Azerbaijan the worship that is professed to the fatherly figure of the nation, that directs its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This it was maintained in the power until 2003, moment in which yielded the witness to its son Ilham.
At least the older people of Azerbaijan do not they know what is the poverty.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same quantity in euro) in concept of monthly pension, a quantity with the one that can live itself well keeping in mind the situation here.
And perhaps the gray son of Mirzayeva be right: "In our culture the greater very are respected".
They live in a great family, they are beloved, they receive all the necessary cares and they are happy.
As if this it was not sufficient reason to be maintained with life many years...
In the Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to the Cairo.
Demonstrations that compete among itself in the Cairo show the tremendous division in which is plunged the country.
The future constitution, with the sharia as base, turns out to be very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in pathos.
"We should surpass the transition.
And that that occur is my responsibility, before the town and before God", affirmed in the public television.
Its speech went directed to all the town, above all to the Coptic Christians, the liberals, the Moslems illustrated and the secular.
All they, plunged hopeless up to now in a confused opposition, they are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Moslem community.
Just as it explains Mohammed Mursi, almost asking pardon, has had that to annul of temporary form the competences of the Constitutional Court and to expand its "to be able to save the revolution".
Nevertheless, neither the Egyptians neither the entire world know very well what this engineer of 61 years with a title of doctorate offered by the Southern University of California wants to save really.
It intends to deprive of its power to the judgeship?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced for a composed constituent assembly for 100 predominantly pro-islamic members in a nocturnal meeting of 15 hours of duration, they are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, in the rough draft also he is said that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of the Islamic right".
Nevertheless, ¿what does that signify of "principles"?
This was and continues being open to the interpretation and seems that the pro-islamic are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal room to maneuver that carries prepared, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all the questions relating to the sharia is obligatory to consult to the University Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic institution of the country with a great to be able in all the Sunni Islamism.
It has no reason to be thus, but this can signify that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the impeachment of the judgeship.
Great part of the rough draft of the constitution is open to the interpretation
What also turns out to be problematic is that intends to maintain the military jurisdiction.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak these courts served to exercise a hard repression on the opposition.
After it it fell of the dictator until 11,000 civilians people under arrest in military prisons were found.
Just as it establishes the rough draft, the State should protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "to promote its morale and its values".
It is a matter of a so inexact formulation in legal terms that with the aid of this article the state institutions would be able even to control the contents of the cinematography and the literature.
Speaking frankly does not be a matter of another thing that of reproof.
Certainly that no article establishes of explicit form the equality between men and women.
On the other hand another prohíbe to offend or to slander the Prophet Mohammed and to its bequests.
Nevertheless, does not remain clear what is an offense and how should be guilty person.
Equal of doubtful is the formulation that prohíbe the "offense to the people"
Is sufficient a caricature of the president or a joke on a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, as many other things in the rough draft that has been presented to Mursi for its firm and that according to, its words, "very quick" will be presented the Egyptians for to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
Weeks ago that the opposition is closing rows set against the superiority of the pro-islamic.
Ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony in the afternoon of Friday in the plaza Tahrir of the I Decay and they swore to cause to fail the Minutes before go into effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will finish conquering", affirms Hamdin Sabbahi, that occupies the third place in the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel of the Peace and exdirector of the International Agency of Atomic Energy, Mohamed The-Baradei, declared that the rough draft of the constitution should be "in the bucket of the trash of the history".
Through Twitter he accused the followers of Mursi to wanted to head a "coup d'etat against the democracy".
"When it call the referendum we will go to its palace and we will oust it", affirms the opposing one Jasser Said.
"Not yet we are tired, the blood of our brothers not yet has been atoned for", was cited in the Egyptian media to the opposing politician Chaled Ali.
And various judges announced that they did not desire to supervise the referendum, for which would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
In turn, the Moslem community well organized did a calling to celebrate a counter-demonstration; just in case not in the plaza Tahrir, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of The Cairo.
Many women covers with a veil and followers of the salafistas took part in the same one to the shout of: "The town requires the divine law enforcement".
They required to Mursi "to clean the country", at the same time that proclaimed: "The Koran is our constitution".
A fight by the sovereignty of the symbolic plaza Tahrir, where began all, to have caused a similar situation to that of a civil war.
It is evident that the followers of Mursi did not want to be risked to that something thus to happen.
The Moslem brothers affirmed that so much the ones that are opposed to the rough draft of the constitution as the followers of the same one would have expressed their high opinions and clearly.
Now would have arrived the moment to leave that the town to decide in the ballot boxes what direction should continue the country.
In this sense, seems that the rough draft of the pro-islamic has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' not even appears"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process forced that in reality should have lasted to February and to have included all the social forces.
This lawyer of 48 years specialized in human rights and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Moslem brothers when they were found retained in prison or they had to face a judgment during the dictatorship of Mubarak.
Not because to share their ideology, but because for him the Human Rights are indivisible.
For that reason was struck, condemned and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Derechos Human 'not even appears in the new constitution ", regrets in a conversation with the newspaper" Welt am Sonntag ".
The enlargement of the competences of Mursi to the three powers of the State did that this lawyer was resigned.
The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic play and they will carry to Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of fortifying the civil company, what has done the president is to revoke it", regrets Saeda.
Nevertheless, the democracy cannot function without the organizations of the civil company.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological fight that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This would be able to be returned in its against.
A demonstrator in the plaza Tahrir notifies: "You are conceiving a monster that will not be able to control".
The rakfisk Norwegian: The smelliest fish of the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the greater standards of living, not only of Europe but of the world.
It is possible that the success of the country keep some relation with its avidity by an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of cheeses excessively cured.
Colóquelos in the middle of a humid and dirty soccer clothes mountain.
Leave it there a week.
It will be able then to smell the paralyzing fragrance of the rakfisk, one of the finenesses of Norway.
I find me in the small city of Fagernes, to some three hours of Oslo.
Is snow-covered. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, fleet in the air.
The rakfisk is trout in salting that is left to ferment in water during, depending on the smelly thing that you prefer it, to a year.
To the extent that overshadows and goes doing colder, the Norwegians respond in crowd to a festival that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of it more, by thus tell it, captivating.
"Crude oil is eaten and then a glass is drunk of aquavit of a drink", says Havard Halvarsen, fireman of the city that is also what is known like the "General of the Rakfisk", that takes charge of organizing the festival.
On all sides we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and drinking of a drink important quantities of the beverage.
"To some people he likes more the aquavit that the rakfisk", affirms Havard.
The beverage can kill the smell.
I test some pieces.
If you can avoid to pass it near the nose, is not ill; is not very different to a portion of sushi that have traveled through a few kilometers in bus.
The rakfisk is a product that a very different epoch stems from, in which the poverty whipped Norway and in which, before to exist the cooling, the fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in full winter, when already is well fermented, is removed and, evidently with the inactive senses due to the alcohol, is eaten.
It does only a generation, thousands of Norwegians were seen obliged to abandon their country in search of work, and they emigrated chiefly to United States.
At present, the population is enlarging quickly; more than the 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high salaries and a complete system of social services.
A current of inhabitants of Sweden, the rival old woman and even does not too much a lot more rich than Norway, arrives at this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered somewhat important, an essential, although quite smelly part, of the past of Norway.
He is found among the most expensive dishes than they can be bought.
But, in fact, all is expensive. A cane of beer or a sándwich cost you the trifle of 10€($14) each one.
Norway does not be used to appearing in the order of business of the international news and to the majority of Norwegians he likes that thus be.
Here the people still is unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the racist of far right that bombarded to shots and murdered 77 people, among the ones that there were men, women and children.
In their place, they refer to the cross-fire as "the event of July 22".
To the Norwegians costs them a lot to believe that in its peaceful country one of its was capable to commit such cruelty and homicide.
After a lot of of the current wealth of Norway the growth is found, from principles of the 70, of one of the industries of petroleum and of larger gas of the world.
"But the petroleum is not the only reason why goes us so well", affirms Anna, our maid, while goes passing trays from rakfisk and that, with its long blonde long hair and its surprising blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian welfare.
"We are, like you say, prudent people".
Its English, like that of the majority of people in this country, is impeccable.
"Do not we like to boast, does not us like the ostentation".
Norway has negotiated its oil wealth with a lot of caution; all, except a small percentage of the money originating in this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of the future generations.
While everyone squandered money that did not have during the years that preceded the financial crisis everywhere, Norway maintained the wallet well closed.
"While we can ski in winter and to do hiking in summer, we are happy", he says Anna.
"And to eat rakfisk", adds with an unfolded laughter.
I am in the snow doing queue to eat something; already I have had sufficient rakfisk.
Now a hamburger of moose is without quite succulent and somewhat different doubt that to savor.
But at night, returns that smelly fish.
The hotel in which I lodge is me one of the many localities in which a supper is celebrated of rakfisk in which the members of a household vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that more puts to test the nostrils.
A television has connected in direct with a presenter that carries bow tie and that is surrounded by dishes of rakfisk.
The contest of Eurovision seems.
"¿Which are your scorings for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here is our scoring, Havard."
There are laughters and applauses.
A man falls of the chair, perhaps conquered by the aquavit.
Or perhaps be the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Rock Grandson is faced to a hard start
While the coming President of Mexico, Enrique Rock Grandson, is prepared to take possession of its charge, the correspondent of the BBC, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges to the ones that the new president will be faced and the different expectations of its population.
The traffic in Mexico City is especially evil at present.
In a city that, in the better circumstances, already is in and of itself congested, from Monday has been installed a fence of steel that cuts several of the main highways that carry to the city and that is causing an enormous chaos in the highways.
The objective, nevertheless, was not to impede that the workers could arrive at their place of work, but to avoid that the demonstrators could arrive at the parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Rock Grandson, will receive the presidential band and will assume the management of the nation.
It is faced to a complicated task.
Mexico has gone obtaining good economic results during the departing government of Felipe Cauldron, but the country he is found submerged in a war against the narcotráfco that has charged himself already some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has the great commitment with the Mexican town to reduce the violence", explained the Mr. Rock Grandson at the beginning from this week to the u.s. president, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
"I am going to propose a new strategy of security that will permit us to reach that objective".
Before codearse with the president of the United States, the prior political experience of the Mr. Rock was like the governor of its native state, that of Mexico.
A state very populated and with a fast growth, that surrounds the capital; The opinions on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he was used to moving.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valley of the Brave one, for example, recalls him itself with affection.
Its residents attribute him the merit of the growth of the tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructures.
To arrive at the city can be conducted for one of the new highways of the Mr. Rock Grandson, what supposes an enormous improvement compared with the full and cracked highways of potholes that were rehabilitated.
Also plates with their name in the entrance of a modern sports center and of an impressive interactive museum on the climatic change can be seen.
"We trust in which he manage to carry out a lasting and real change", its friend says and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, representative of the party of the Mr. Rock Grandson, the PRI.
"Particularly, in which refers to security and economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our so much country needs".
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in the power, the PRI was superseded by Vicente Fox in the year 2000.
The representative Olvera admits that, after 12 years out of the presidential palace of The Pines, inside the party there are many expectations with respect to Enrique Rock Grandson.
It rejects also the qualification that the opposition does of lack of essence of the new president.
"Is a very sincere man, very compromised and with an excellent vision of the country.
It is a fantastic statesman and, above all, is a person that knows to listen."
Nevertheless, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that has many people on its old governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, acquaintance also as City Neza, the contrast with the streets paved of Valley of the Brave one could not be greater.
It hidden low sections of high freeway is, in many senses, a suburb of Mexico City herself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year the intervention of the soldiers was asked so that they helped in the fight against the bands of drug that operate in the neighborhoods and the violence against the women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, situated next to a dump of trash, they have left themselves abandoned in only the two last years the murdered women dozens bodies.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while the Mr. Rock Grandson was the governor, an a lot more high rate than that of City Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is innocent women homicide synonym.
The critics of the Mr. Rock Grandson say, in the best of the cases, that did not know to undertake the problem of the feminicidio while was in the charge.
The most critical they accuse its administration to do the blind eye.
In a house of concrete, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to do efforts to contain the tears while shows me photographs of its daughter dead, Mariana Moon.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana killed itself in 2010.
Nevertheless, its family believes that its couple murdered it.
"When I arrived at its house, seemed as if they had cleaned him the body", recalls the lady Buendía.
"There were signs that had been struck and the severity mortis already had appeared".
While its mother relates the history, a photography of Mariana observes since the walls, next to a cross in which an only word reads itself: Justice.
Nevertheless, that is exactly what the family says that he has been denied him.
"The authorities of the state have tried me as if was a gossipy old woman, an alborotadora, a moaner.
What want is that one simply accept what they say and that be silenced".
"But that it cannot be thus when there they have been so many irregularities and so much negligence", affirms.
The presidential band that the Grandson Rock President will receive on Saturday will come accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Scores of thousands of families have been seen affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the last six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his mandate.
"I expect that be the same type of president that was when was governor", the representative of the PRI he says Olvera in Valley of the Brave one.
Nevertheless, that is exactly what the families of the victims of City Neza more fear.
Bradley Manning did not denounce evils deals, they as affirm the public prosecutors
The public prosecutors try to face the accusations of abuses of Bradley Manning during their stay in prison
The judgment itself center in the period of Manning in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia
The defense wants that be rejected the case basing on that the imprisonment of Manning was severe
The soldier of the army is accused to steal thousands of confidential documents.
The public prosecutors tried to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, confidential information the greater filtration defendant in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the bad deals that now alleges that suffered while low military detention was found.
During the interrogation that the district attorney's office carried out to Manning in a prior view to the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the fiscal Commander Ashden Fein affirmed that the registrations of the weekly visits of officials of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, they do not show any accusation on the deal that received.
The interrogation, that was carried out during a view carried out because of the petition of the defense that the case was rejected given that its imprisonment had been hard and that it already there was supposed sufficient punishment, a day arrived after Manning to have testified that had thought about being killed while was detained.
The analyst of intelligence of the army, arrested in June of 2010, is accused to steal thousands of confidential documents while was of service in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks unconfirmed never that Manning was the source of information.
In the view of Friday, Fein revised with Manning the forms that the officials filled after the visits to Manning during its arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where was imprisoned in state of maximum imprisonment from July from 2010 to April 2011.
The officials would have carried out questions to Manning and noted their answers.
When Friday Fein asked on the forms, Manning recognized that had qualified the processing that the guards they gave him as "excellent" and the processing received in the installations in general like "very professional".
The forms do not show any accusation of bad deals, in spite of the fact that the officials asked to Manning directly on the processing that received, affirmed Fein.
Manning responded that had expressed their worry on some questions and that the officials that visited they had spoken him of those problems and they had indicated him that they would treat, but that did not leave constancy of those questions in the registration.
"They wrote 'without incidents' (after to have spoken of the problems) but this signifies necessarily that I not to have mentioned no problem", said Manning.
He the judge, Colonel of the Army Denise Lind, also he asked to Manning why had not denounced the processing that received during the meeting that took place in January of 2011 with a counsel responsible for examining the intentions of suicide that had expressed in a form months before.
Manning responded that its intention during that meeting was that of obtaining the reduction of the state of "prevention of wounds" under which was found.
The soldiers said that they had him placed under that restrictive state, that a degree is found by underneath of that of caution by possible suicide, to guarantee its protection and the security of other people.
"He wanted that the greater state he knew that I he was well and (he wanted) to stop being low prevention of wounds... to be able to enjoy what, since my point of view, is a better quality of life", said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on its arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where was retained during almost two months before being transferred to the military prison situated in the base of them marinate in Quantico, Virginia, in July of 2010.
He said that he had considered to be killed in Kuwait and that in an occasion he lost the knowledge due to the heat.
He said that the fact that itself be not to permitted him to know what was passing him or what happened in the exterior world was very grievous.
"My world was reduced only to the Camp Arafjon, to that cage", explained Manning Thursday.
"I believed that was going to die in that cage".
Manning affirmed that, once transferred to Quantico, passed the majority of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that only was permitted him to have a mattress, a blanket, some slippers, something of clothes and its eyeglasses.
It explained that tried to be moved all the time, since was prohibited to sleep or even to be fallen during the day.
Manning affirmed that had always an outside coming light aiming at its eyes while slept.
He said that if the guards could not see him the face when turned around at night, they awoke him so that to be given again the return.
The lawyer of Manning presented in January of 2011 a formal claim on the processing that received Manning.
Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April of 2011.
Friday the judge asked to Manning on a summing-up that had carried out in the statement on Thursday, according to which, after to be obliged a night to sleep naked in his cell of Quantico, him he was obliged during a morning recount to remain standing desdnudo in front of the guards and of other prisoners.
Manning had testified that never had been given him the opportunity to be covered with the blanket during the recount.
During the interrogation of the judge Friday, Manning said that deduced for the order that the guard gave him that should drop the blanket with the one that would be able to have covered, but recognized that nobody had ordered him that he dropped it.
Manning testified Thursday that had obliged to sleep naked the previous night on account of an intent by showing an official that did not suppose a danger for itself.
Manning affirmed that had said the official that would be able to have utilized the elastic of its underwear or its flip-flops to be injured but that it had not done.
Manning testified that that night they had withdrawn of their cell their underwear, their flip-flops and their eyeglasses.
Its lawyers have the hope that the judge have at least in account the experiences by the ones that passed during its stay in prison and reduce drastically its sentence in the event that to be condemned in the court martial, that is predicted that harms at the beginning of next year.
The defense affirmed that anticipates to do that Manning be declared guilty of smaller crimes and to defend other respected accusations too much extremes.
It is predicted that the view resume this weekend and it is expected that the public prosecutors argue that the conditions of the detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was retained according to the norms of application to every person under arrest that be found under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, to cause of illegal form the publication of information on the Internet, filtration of information of the national defense and robbery of property or public registrations.
If it is declared guilty of all the charges, would be able to be faced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
It affirms that many were seen obliged to abandon Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to criticize the ones that were; he says that recall the Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-American are found trapped between two worlds.
In a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had descended for the terrace and arrived at the immigration processing zone and already was completely confused.
Some placards indicated the road toward two queues: a for "Mexican" and another for "Foreign".
I remained there some seconds without be sure toward where should go.
Upon having grown in California Central, during all my life they have called me "Mexican".
Is a matter of ethnic shorthand, in the same way in which my friends of Boston refer to itself as "Irish" or my friends of new York qualify to itself "Italian".
Later I decided me for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in the country of my grandfather, the shorthand or the hyphens were not necessary.
Simply was American.
I speak Spanish. It sufficiently well as to handle me during an interview in this tongue.
But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native and I cannot get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I put me in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment of this week in which the chosen president of Mexico, Enrique Rock Grandson, visited the White House to be met with the President Obama.
In the agenda of the day, as usual that gather the leaders of these two countries, was evident: immigration, drugs and commerce.
Rock Grandson was desiring to speak also of the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons by the ones that in these moments is so probable that a Mexican remain in Mexico since he venture to go to the United States.
It wants to be associated with United States and Canada and to create in North America a commercial block in the style of the European Union.
Besides, Rock Grandson promised to continue fighting against the cartels of the drug in Mexico, although did not give details.
For Mexico, the relation with the United States is complicated and is full of grudge.
Probably the majority of Americans never they agree that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and they obliged their leaders to yield the half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for the Mexicans, that think about centuries, not in minutes, the elements that recall they are themselves it all over.
So, at the moment in which an official of the United States says any thing that involve the more critical low to Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, so much in the press as among the Mexican elite, on how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Montezuma are put on the warpath.
And even so, for Mexico, the relation that really supposes all a challenge is the one that have with the more than 35 million Mexican-American that live in the United States.
We speak of grudge?
There is a lot.
In Mexico there is winners and losing, people for the ones that the country provides opportunities and other for the ones that is not thus.
The only reason why there is so many people of Mexican ancestry living in cities as The Angels, The fertile plain, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, in some point of our family tree, there was a person, that the father or the mother or some of the grandfathers, to which closed him itself the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go toward the north.
And the majority of the times that person inserted in a specific profile: dark skin, a level of low studies, originating in a poor town, etc.
We are its descending and we are them loyal.
To Mexico not.
And, in spite of the fact that perhaps we are living now the American dream, upon having gone to good schools and to have had good works, we cannot lose never of view that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Is possible that at times our identity be not clear, but our loyalty yes that is it.
Is for the United States.
Besides, we are conscious that to many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the leading class do not we like them.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a commemorative one of a humiliating rout and they look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not it sufficient Mexican.
Our Spaniard never will be it sufficient good and our ties with Mexico never will be it sufficient strong.
To its way to see, our existence is synonym of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they had not gone.
And now us we would not find trapped after this curtain of silk, living well in the United States but, even so, as solitary souls.
My wife, that was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when was a girl, he recalls me that this close contact between the Mexicans he exists and the Mexican-American because the first know with more solidity who are and to the seconds this I bother them.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
In the meantime, many Mexican-American that know feel that they are part of none of the two.
It charms us to listen to the Mexican group The north Tigers, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but are not established to none of them.
In Mexico they see us as the Americans.
And in the United States is considered us Mexicans.
Now, to complicate still more the things, for which I have me aware during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect again with the diaspora.
They want that the Mexican-American work as "ambassadors" of Mexico unscripted, representing its interests in the United States.
We would tell our companions American the fantastic thing that is to visit that country and we would pressure the political leaders so that they reinforced their ties with Mexico.
Yes, clear...
That is not going to pass.
There is too much grudge.
And, with the inequality of salaries, the galloping corruption and the violence by drugs, many of us we are not so insurances that be a fantastic country.
I am afraid that you are going to remain alone with this idea, friends.
Is just.
If some Mexicans not yet are prepared to forgive to the United States by the form in which they treated to Mexico a century ago and medium, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-American still be resentful by how treated its relatives does a lot less time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we be more "Mexican" of what thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The high one the fire between Israel and Hamas well could be a probable little base for the peace
Will be able there to be some day a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in Middle East?
Another spilling of blood that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the middle of the useless and habitual discussions on who began first, piles of buildings have remained reduced to debris; more than 140 Palestinians, the majority of them civil, and six Israelis have been murdered and, for the first time, missiles originating in Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolises of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, in spite of the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in its old conflict, all as much as surrounds them in Middle East is changing.
The Arabian spring has left it every fact pieces he like or not, Palestinian and Israelis have remained trapped in the regional disturbance.
Perhaps this do that its fight be still more bloody than before.
Nevertheless, reasons exist to think that its deadly situation of break-even point would be able to be refloated.
A war that neither is lost neither wins
At first sight, the optimism seems at present very difficult to justify.
Even if the high one is maintained the fire agreed November 21, the clashes of this week have reinforced to the hawks of both edicts.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has governed Gaza since 2007, they will affirm to have obliged the Israelis to be withdrawn, in spite of the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And in spite of to have killed some of its leaders and put to pressure to the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable corners and populated of the planet, Israel not to has been able to put an end to Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine at present governed by its implacable rival of Fatah, the Palestinian faction more moderate.
Besides, the leaders of Hamas would be able to come to the conclusion that the time plays its favor.
It given that the pro-islamic they have gone winning throughout the world Arabian influence, Hamas has done powerful and rich friendships.
Turkey, a renascent regional power that previously had been the Moslem ally more close to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Also Katar has done it, one of the dynamic and richest states of the Gulf.
The exultant members of Hamas say that the average Islamic moon is surrounding Israel, since the Lebanon to the north, where dominates the party-militia Hizbulá, passing for Syria, where the rebels of a tendency increasingly more Islamic would be able to oust to Bashar Assad, until arriving at Jordan, where the allies of Hamas are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern side of Israel, the growth of the Moslem Brothers directed by the President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with difference the most populated and fundamental one of the Arabian countries, has changed the equilibrium of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot that governed in Egypt for 30 years to its fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Moslem Brothers are Hamas brothers cousins and their leaders depend more on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, is possible that Hamas arise like the protagonist to which himself cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will jump to the contrary conclusion.
In which refers the military question, they have placed to Hamas in their place.
The system antimissile Dome of Iron of Israel has shown its efficacy and many of the missiles of Hamas have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more tranquil... for a short while.
As for the diplomacy, United States is shown more sign that never; many European countries also blamed to Hamas of to have initiated the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamín Netanyahu, a prime minister that has ignored extensively the process of peace.
Although the rockets shot from Gaza to have put an end to the life of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many terrorists you kill, in part thanks to the barrier that I run West Bank, the main piece of a territory contender to be become state of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue enlarging in spite of the fact that, according to the international legislation, they be illegal.
The Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud has been united to a group of a still more hard line headed by Avigdor Lieberman in the prior period to the elections January 22, is in a good position.
Why spoil to those twisted Palestinians giving them an own state?
If really they governed in the West Bank, ¿would not shoot rockets just as they have done their countrymen in Gaza?
It is better to have them after that wall and to give them a good blow if they raise the head.
Perhaps the hard wing be imposed, although the Arabian spring would be able to alter its calculations.
Although the pro-islamic that take the power in Egypt and in other places they have not too much appreciation to Israel, its priority will be to undertake the internal difficulties.
The budget of defense of Israel is greater that that of its four together Arabian neighbors.
Initiating a war with the superpower of the zone with difficulty will help the new Arabian governments to improve its economies.
That the pragmatist Mr. Morsi have worked with Barack Obama to obtain the high one the fire is a good prediction and would be able to mark the start of something.
Also the Israelis should think long-term.
With the remainder of the Arabian world being returned more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of its right to the self-determination supposes to create an arsenal that a day will exploit in the busy territories by Israel, of the same form that this week exploited a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression already is mining the democracy in the Jewish state and the demography gets worse the situation to the extent that enlarges the Arabian population.
The bloody missions against Gaza each two or three years to reject to Hamas will pay a diplomatic toll each greater time.
Both edicts need a push of alien people to the conflict.
The solution continues being the one that proclaim sensible people of both edicts, the majority of the exterior world and this newspaper: two states and the transfer of territory on the part of Israel by reasons of security.
The hope, small short-term, is that the high one the fire give a little more than impulse to the alien people that are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, that should begin to put brake to the entrance of weapons in Gaza, along with Turkey and Katar, he is found in an unprecedented situation to convince to Hamas that he accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with exchanges of land and a Jerusalem shared.
The Arabs alien to the matter should also pressure to Hamas and Fatah so that they unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent intent to obtain a category of virtual state in the UN.
The Mr. Obama has also an important role as for to manage to carry to Israel to the negotiating table.
During its first mandate omitted to present its own plan for the peace.
Again in the White House, equal seems of reluctant to dedicate him its attention.
This attitude supposes a deplorable vision of future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest for the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinian.
The law of packaged generic of tobacco goes into effect in Australia
Warnings on the risks to smoke and you split of the body with illnesses they light up on packs of a dull green color, that are the same for all the marks of tobacco
The Australian law in matter of tobacco and packaged generic, pioneering in the world, goes into effect and substituting the logos and the colors of the marks by a wrapping of a dull olive green one, some frightening images on behalf of the body with illnesses and representations of children and sick babies by being smokers parents children.
Except for the different images and sanitary warnings, the only difference among the packs, obligatory since on Saturday, are the names of the marks, all they printed in a type of small source.
It is a matter of the strictest state of the world applied upon packaging of tobacco.
The federal government of Australia affirms that the objective is to dissuade the youths to smoke by means of the elimination of the characteristics that do that this habit have glamour.
It trusts in studies that show that if a person has not begun to smoke before the 26 years, a 99% of possibilities exists that never do it.
"He can be seen that the children, even since very early age, they understand the message that the business cigarette manufacturer is trying to sell through their mark", affirmed the minister of federal Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how the girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
In spite of the fact that Australia counts on one of the rates of smokers more drops of the world and that these changes will not affect too much to the benefits of the multinationals, other countries are considering to take similar measures.
The industry cigarette manufacturer has exercised an enormous pressure against the law.
The businesses cigarette manufacturers affirmed that the law would promote the black market of tobacco, in which the cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will lead to serious involuntary consequences", said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco, in Australia.
It will enlarge the quantity of tobacco that will bring the falsificadores of China and Indonesia to sell it in the streets of Australia.
Other people say that its business has been benefited after the approval of the law.
Sandra Has, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, affirmed that the demand of cigarette cases and covered with silicone to cover the unpleasant images of the packs had shot almost from zero two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain' s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
The Mrs. it Has affirmed that Zico had sold to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that was expecting more stock.
"For us is a good business".
According to the experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of the social networks among the demographic sector to which is directed the plan.
After a series of Australian laws that prohíben the publicity in the television and the sponsorship of sports and that oblige the majority of salespersons to put not the cigarettes in sight, the marketing of the tobacco has passed to be carried out in line.
Australia has prohibited the publicity on the Internet to businesses and local web pages, but cannot restrict it in foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and only this small window remains yourself to promote your products, the space in line is the most convincing place in which to be", said Becky Freeman, researcher of public health of the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase of outlines on marks originating in "civic from on foot" published in web pages of social networks as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It fits to be asked if treats only of a private citizen to whom really the cigars they charm him Marlboro and the inconvenience to carry out has been taken a video or if some business of marketing is behind all it.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry itself center more in which implies the new regulation that in the marketing.
The industry has arrived even to pay so that Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic reject the new norms; these countries are affirming before the World Organization of the Commerce that the commerce is being restricted unjustly, in spite of the fact that none of these countries has a volume of significant commerce with Australia.
It is probable that the OMC dictate a resolution in the middle of 2013.
Plibersek affirmed that the government had maintained conversations with other countries that are considering to apply similar laws in matter of packaged of tobacco.
In the year 2001 Canada became the first country that introduced the obligatory nature to include images in the packs.
At present they are obligatory in more than 40 countries, among the ones that they are found Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, south Africa and India is being considered to apply harder laws.
In Australia many smokers are shown defiant.
"The photographs do not affect me.
Simply them do not I pay attention".
"You catch the cigar and guards the package", he says Victor The Hage while buys a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Sincerely, only there is a reason why to would stop smoking: by my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the watertight one King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that the uniform packs do that turn out to be more complicated him to place them in the bookcases.
"Normally it delayed an hour in desenvalar a delivery; now I delay four", affirms Yu.
"The government should have prohibited completely the tobacco and then, already is, is worth, was finished and we close the store", he says while he raises the hands up.
In a world constantly connected, is not so badly to be bored a little
During the festivals of the thanksgiving day of this year, of unexpected form I had to spend five hours in an airport because the airplane in which we flew suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for that another airplane arrived.
So I had a very long time to think about the boredom.
You do not I be going to lie.
Be passed half a day in an airport waiting for that a flight arrive is quite bored, even if you have media to be entertained, like books, magazines or iPhones, without forget us of the stores duty-free.
But each time there is more academic and experts in child development that praise the kindnesses of the boredom.
According to them, is well that, so much we as our children, we bore us occasionally.
Be bored obliges the brain to seek interesting options and that fomente the creativity.
It given that, at present, the majority of us we are connected to this or to that screen, we do not experience the benefits that contributes the boredom.
So, ¿we should accept of good spirit the boredom?
Yes.
And not.
But, already we will speak of it further on.
In the first place, just like many people, supposed that, now that we have more time for the leisure, the boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, just as it affirms Peter Toohey, professor of Greek History and Roman of the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: To Lively History" ("The boredom, an animated history") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not thus.
"In fact, the history of the boredom is very extensive", affirms.
In the walls of Pompeii graffitis in latin on the boredom exist that date from the century I d.C.
Also we should present us how do we define the boredom.
"The problem is that already has defined itself and discussed very diverse ways", indicates John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology of the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the investigations published and to present the idea before a group of discussion formed by 100 people, the Professor Eastwood and its colleagues defined the boredom as the experience of "to desire, but not to be able, to participate in an activity that you full".
It affirms that the difference between the boredom and the apathy is that the person does not do something but he wants to do it.
It indicates that with the apathy not the desire to do exists something.
The main experience of the boredom, affirms, is "the alteration of the process of attention, associate to spirit state a reduction and to a sensation that the time passes slowly".
The boredom can sound terribly seemed to the depression.
Nevertheless, the Professor Eastwood says that, although they can be related, the people that are bored tend to see the problem as a question of the environment or of the world, while the people that are depressed consider that the problem they they have it.
At times we believe that we are bored, when what happens us in reality is that we have problems to concentrate us.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom or Terms of Attention", published in the edition of September of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, the Professor Eastwood and its colleagues were remitted to a previous experiment in which the participants listened a tape of a person that read the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the adjacent room a program of television to every volume that did not keep any relation, other they listened it with the low volume, so that barely was perceptible, while the third group did not listen the audio at no time.
The group that the program with the low volume listened showed more boredom than the other two groups; cost to be concentrated, but they were not sure by what and they attributed it to the boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of the attention can carry to the boredom", indicated Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you are doing somewhat bored, as to detect faulty pieces in a line of production, a music that distract you can help you not to bore you".
"In fact, at present we know that to be moved or to do hooks, actions that often are interpreted like sign of boredom, they are able in reality to help to fight it, since they do that that person be physically more he alerts".
"The investigations show that those children to the ones that is permitted them to be moved they learn more and they retain more information than those to the ones that is obliged them to be quiet", affirms the Professor Fenske.
All we know what is to be bored in some moment: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, an especially bored movie.
But some people have more tendency to be bored that other.
To help to measure it, some investigators developed in the years 80 a "scale of tendency to the boredom".
The scale includes questions as "many of the things that I have to cause they are repetitive and monotonous" and "there is so many things that interest me that I do not have time to do it all".
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology of the University of West Florida, affirms that, utilizing happinesses scales, the investigators have discovered that the boys have more tendency to be bored most often that the girls, and concretely they need more more various and external stimulation.
But, in general, the adolescents are a type of group that is bored with plenty of facility.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of common and human Development of the University of Illinois, he carried out an experiment in which he was put in contact with 400 adolescents and with his parents between seven and eight times a day by means of a search.
It discovered that the 32 percent of the adolescents said that was bored while was in the school or doing you owe them, while the 23 percent said that was bored when was not in the school.
On the other hand, the 3 percent of the parents they said that they were bored.
The Professor Larson said that did not know if the percentages of current boredom, 21 years later, would be superiors or lower.
But he said that what yes he knew he was that "the adolescence is a period in which the boredom reaches their higher elevations", to a large extent due to that so much to the children as to the adolescents is not given them a great control on what want to do.
So, returning to my question of the principle: It is good to be bored?
At times it is not, since, carried to the extreme, can do that we expose us to absurd physical risks, as to do bets or to fall in the consumption of substances as method to fight it, just as they show the investigations.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between the boredom and the creativity, as affirms the Professor Vodanovich, that has been studying this question during more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way that has the brain to tell you that you should be doing another thing", says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology of the University of new York.
But the brain does not always know what is it more appropriate.
If you are bored and utilize that energy to touch the guitar or to cook, that you satisfará.
But if you watch television, is possible that satisfy you short-term, but not long-term.
"So, if your son is bored and you give an iPad, he is possible that no longer he be bored, but he there will not be learned to be entertained for itself or to be rationed", he affirms the Professor Fenske.
And "that capacity to be rationed applies to other situations", indicates.
Your son does not only learn to be entertained in and of itself, but he learns to be controlled better in other areas.
I do not believe that really we want to praise the boredom.
But we should neither be too much critics with him.
Our objective should be, more well, that of feeling us comfortable sections of the constant rumor of the activities and the technologies.
The professor Eastwood agrees.
"To our way to see, we need to bore us more, but the boredom is a too grievous and disturbing desire as to relate to something that is worthwhile", affirms.
It indicates that what the people really seeks is a way to disconnect and to enjoy a time-out.
"In an environment in which we are constantly sobreestimulados", affirms, "is difficult to find forms to center our attention when the noise ceases".
Red: without book of instructions for the new law on the consumption of marijuana
Anthony Orozco, student of 19 years in a common institute and footballer of the southeast of Red, is faced to a criminal trial by something that quick will be legal in all the state: the possession of some stones of marijuana and a pipe that utilized to smoke it.
Orozco says that a day of September, he and some friends conducted for Lamar, in the plains close to the border of Kansas, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco received a judicial citation by possession of drugs and articles related (smaller crimes that involve each one a fine of 100 U.S. dollars) in which him was reported of the date of the judgment.
"They treat us as to criminals", he says Orozco.
And they are it?
In the weeks of following uncertainty to the voting that took place in Red for the legalization of the possession of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of smaller causes by possession of drugs depends less than the law that of the location.
Hundreds of smaller crimes by possession of marijuana are being annulled so much here as in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was approved.
The departments of police have left to present charges against the greater of 21 years by small-scale possession, that the law will be approved legally once have gone into effect in the next weeks.
But the public prosecutors of districts more conservatives of Red have compromised to continue ahead with the open cases by possession of marijuana and still are citing people.
At the same time, several cities, since the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, they are voting to impede that stores of marijuana, authorized recently be opened, in its communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be the following thing", said Daniel J. Oates, leader of police in Aurora, just to the east of Denver.
Who they take charge of the regulations in the state of Washington also they are turning over the matter.
And they continue seeking advice to establish a production licenses system, production, distribution and sale; all it before arrive the date limit, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for well or for badly, Red goes for in front of the majority of the states as for the regulation of the use of the marijuana, first with end terapeúticos and now for recreational use.
"Red it has a more regulated market, so will be a good guide", affirms Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Commission of control of the alcohol of the state of Washington.
But the Mr. Smith admits that any place or system only can do suggestions on what would be able to function.
"Not a true precedent exists that serve us of model", affirms.
The law of Washington, called I-502, goes into effect December 6, what leaves also a year during which will sit on the fence, since the system of licenses in that state not yet will exist, but the possession will be legal.
Besides, some delicate mechanical questions exist that should be resolved during that period, like the way to maintain an equilibrium among the demand of the state to offer an "adequate access" to the authorized marijuana and their cannabis business to carry out prohibition in a lower radio to 300 meters of schools, parks, zones of play childlike or central childlike.
"In no place will turn out to be more difficult to locate a business of authorized cannabis that in the urban zones, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle", says Ben Livingston, spokesman of the Center for the legal cannabis, a research team created recently.
November 21, Oates, the leader of police of Aurora, sent an e-mail to its police officers in which reported that the public prosecutor of the city to would stop interposing legal actions by light lacks by possession of marijuana to older people of 21 years and of that the police to would stop presenting charges against those crimes "effective immediate".
The leader of police Oates said that they would take charge of causing to comply the regulation of the city that to regulate the cultivation of marijuana with therapeutic end and that would continue pursuing dealers and salespersons of drug.
In the county of Weld, in the north of Red, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.
After the voting, assured that its office would continue pursuing the marijuana possession cases, chiefly to pressure the consumers and that decide to receive processing.
At present, 119 people are faced to charges by possession of 56 grams or less than marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to interpose legal actions against those lacks that just as they were produced they were crime", he said the Mr. Buck in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places as the rural county of Table, where the voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of the marijuana.
The police of Grand Junction, the greater city of the county, no longer quotes adults by possession of small quantities.
Even Hautzinger, district attorney of the county, supported this decision, but also decided to reject none of the pending cases by possession.
"Do not I consider that wasting time upon continuing causing complying the law until this change", affirmed.
In spite of the fact that the 55 percent of the voters supported the measure, never was considered that to carry the consumption of marijuana for recreational use to the breast of the government and of the judicial system went to be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise for all the state show a marked ambivalence among the officials regarding the great experiment ecologist in this state.
"It is a matter of a cultural barrier with the district attorneys", affirms they Be McAllister, a lawyer of Denver that represents the defendants by possession of marijuana and that is local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the law on the marijuana.
"They have passed so much time carrying to people before the courts that, in reality, yet they cannot accept that be legal", affirmed.
Upon being the first states that consider the small quantities of marijuana in the same way that if was alcohol, Red and Washington they are prepared to be become the cases of test to national level as for the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and civil servants include a new border of legal sales, also they expect anxious to receive indications of the federal government, that still foresees the consideration of the sale and the cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of the marijuana have the hope that the Department of justice yield.
In spite of the fact that some noticeable arrests of patients they have been produced and salespersons of marijuana for therapeutic end, the federal government has permitted mostly that exist marijuana sale business with these end in Red, Washington and 16 states more.
"Although it is probable that the antidrug agents throw not down the doors to confiscate a market of small drug, probably they will be shown reluctant to permit the operation of regular stores by the state for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law", he said Kevin A. Sabet, an exasesor of antidrug politics of the administration of Obama.
Several cities of Red do not wait for that act the federal authorities.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, in spite of the fact that will pass around a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a prohibition of six months and is probable that approve it next week.
"Do not we want to put us in a situation in which we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem to federal level", explained Bob Nicholson, member of the City Hall.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what voted the community set against vote in favor of what voted the state."
Many questions arise on the matter.
Petronella Wyatt: "They hounded me to throwing me of Oxford by being a Tory"
Itself it is not attacked the university students by its alone points of view now
I remember no moment in my life in which have not been dreaming in obtaining a plaza in the University of Oxford.
So much my father as my older brother they had been in which I supposed was the best place of the world to learn, a Greek symposium of it was contemporary that promoted the two pillars of the civilization: the thought free and the tolerance.
Nevertheless, at two o'clock weeks to occupy my plaza in the Worcester College to ends of the years 80 to study the career of History, already had done the suitcases, what unchained the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and he was thrown to cry.
My friends were disconcerted.
The periodic one The Evening Standard affirmed that I had abandoned because did not tolerate that some companions of university maintained sexual relations in the room from to the side.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that had gone me because they obliged me to drink in cups chipped.
The truth was less amusing.
I fled there.
Yes, I fled, because had been submitted to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not due to my extravagant name, neither to the fact that came from a private school.
They hounded me for an only reason, that in the cradle of the supposed illustration resulted somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the dead one Woodrow Wyatt, was a noticeable advisor of Margaret Thatcher and I he supported to the conservative party.
That perhaps they be asked why comes now.
Well, various reports indicate that a new right center students generation is suffering a similar pursuit.
The hatred institutionalized and growing toward the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them demanded the same rights equality level that have the homosexuals, the disabled and the ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (degree students group) of the Corpus Christi College affirm that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as not pleasing people" by their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the opportunities equality committee of their university school to be assured to be able to express their opinions freely.
Its situation was not seen favored by a recent documentary one of the BBC2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The paradise: young, brilliant and of right) on the politics of the students and that presented to the Tories as eccentric and neo-nazi.
It showed the student of postgraduate course Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative party of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting up a silver suit and a cane with the silver handle.
In other universities, the conservative students say that treats them itself as "scapegoats" by the highest registration rates introduction.
Luke Black, of 20 years and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Sunday paper that "a growing tendency of left in the universities exists.
The people assumes that we are like the Bullingdon Club without neither even knowing us".
Samuel Roberts, of 21 years and student of history in Corpus Christi that presented the motion for a greater protection, he affirms that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, of 19 years and chosen president of the OUCA, affirms that the attitude of the members of the JCR toward the people that are of right center has got worse.
"This supposes a threat for the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the members", affirms.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was aloner than the a.
I entered the university in September of 1986, was a youth of 18 terribly timid years.
The hatred toward the Conservative Party was in its higher point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny to Margaret Thatcher, old student, a title "honoris cause" after the cuts in the financing of the higher Education.
The environment to have done to tremble of fright to any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students are known and they know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that expected me.
I discovered that the professors did not only do the blind eye before the mockery that was done of the conservative university students, but they participated in her willingly.
The politics of the strike of the miners, the privatization and the opposition of the government to the sanctions against the apartheid in south Africa arrived to the rooms of wood of the seminar.
To the first one that I attended they should be translated to the English French texts of the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came subsequently.
"Young lady Wyatt", the professor said Harry Pitt (already dead), "please, translate the first paragraph".
I did not give neither a.
Pitt, a low man with a face that mass of biscuit seemed, knew well how to expel evil bile.
"¿It is that the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or is that, simply, are fools?", he asked.
The other university students laughed.
The eyes of the tears burned me that tried to contain.
"I suggest that go to classes of French in its free time, whenever be not too busy knowing people", gruñó Pitt.
I returned to my room as a soul in grief.
That night I sat down alone at the moment of the supper in the university; then I felt a light clap in the back.
It was a student of English of second called year James that was presented like member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", told me kindly.
"I am afraid that thus is like goes the thing.
They are put with any that be suspect to be Tory.
For it is very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you he will be still worse.
Many Tories recently arrived to pretend to be laborists".
Further on, in a pub local, I tried cowardly to dissemble.
I insisted that was not according to everything that said the Mrs. Thatcher.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A student of first year of Philosophy, Political and Economy that, paradoxically, he had studied in Eton, he said: "You are a daughter of a fascist hog.
You are contaminated".
Other students adopted that ditty.
I became the dirty one corrupted.
"¿How they have sexual relations the Tories?", he asked one.
"They are given a beating the one to the other, ¿not?"
I felt in the same way that senses the homosexuals before the liberal law of the years 60.
It would be able some day to carry a normal life in Oxford?
He would see me obliged to remain with people that thought as I only after the nightfall?
It would have that to do me laborist and to repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that expected they were presented me as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was they Establish norms for Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined to my university school.
They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also advisor of Thatcher in foreign policy and one of the people that their speeches they wrote him.
Barely was for there.
It detested the place because considered the provincial and insignificant and by its adhesion to the marxist-deterministic vision of the history.
In 1997 it accepted a professorship in the University of Bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you are not going to be happy", told me.
I began to displace me daily of Oxford home of my parents in London, finding refuge in my relatives and friends of more open metropolitan mentality.
I told him my father that hated Oxford and why.
Me did not he believe.
When he studied there in the years 40, all the were accepted political points of view.
"But if it is the best place of the world", said with sadness.
"They never would do that, not there among my beloved needles of daydream.
To my communist friends always they had an impeccable attitude".
Its sore eyes began to be clouded.
"You give him another opportunity.
I am sure that they have done the alone to joke.
It would leave itself me the heart if left it."
It exhausted of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A my friend, that also supported to the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and had renounced its creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of History had insinuated, speaking completely in serious, that I he was an "enemy of the town", I decided to do the same thing.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had me "wash the brain" and I called them "old stupid".
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford.
By that then my father wrote two weekly columns in the press of Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I was inside snuggled of fear and, past five minutes, my pursuers desisted.
When they were I did the suitcase and I caught the first train to London.
Never I returned.
Perhaps call me weak llorona.
But any person of 18 years should be seen submitted to such level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What results still more tragic is that was Oxford, that only has not formed to 14 first ministers of the Conservative party but, to day of today, hides after an equality deserved nothing reputation and liberty of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegance to the notoriety"
Because of the sample "Valentino: Teacher of the Dressmaking", that this week in London has been inaugurated, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clientas of the Italian designer
Somerset House, old residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the worthy British capital to receive an exposition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Teacher of the Dressmaking", a tremendous retrospective that gathers more than 130 dresses of high fashion created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I worship this palace", he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a history whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but that would not be able to have been written without his distinguished clientas.
Valentino has always felt fascination by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exposition, open to the next one 3 of March, private letters they abound and photos with the firm of the select of the aristocracy, since the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing for the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of its social ascent: of humble couturier of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to idol of the "jet-set" international.
Being lover of the royalty does not have anything of evil.
"At least they do not put out the cigarette butts of her cigarettes on your magnificent carpet as do some beautiful fame of the pop music", the baroness says Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the years 60 and 70, both we lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and he entertains with generosity and elegance.
"To all charmed us to be guests to its chalet in Gstaad", explains the exmujer of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of beauties forgot as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety.
And even so, is a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting up a Valentino
The model one Argentina Valeria Mazza does neither forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza I gave Spagna, in Rome, we went to have dinner to its flat.
We were twenty people, among the ones that were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In each detail of the flat, the decoration, the food, the music, in all he was seen and he felt his spirit.
"To each one of the guests caused felt us important and beloved", recalls the "top model", that began to work with him during the Week of high Fashion of Paris, in 1995.
"Never it passes fashionable because its designs are works of art", concludes.
Parade of ancestry
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions, but of loves well corresponded.
He loves to the people with good education and better titles, and they love him he.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamurosa runway of sixty meters of long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and he should parade for the runway to contemplate to an "audience" of daydream that lights up masterpieces of Valentino, like the dress that chose Jackie Kennedy for its wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that utilized Monica Vitti In "The Notte", or a shelter of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Owe.
In that public of models names shine like that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Glory von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofía of Hapsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006
Many of those clientas say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
Was a pants, a shirt, a vest "razor blade" and a jacket of the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that did me", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer her him above other by her femininity, by her great love to the women, because highlights our beauty", adds the former duchess of Fair.
I they like a lot of the colors that utilizes, they have great light and they are "donor" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and prescriptora fashionable Patrician della Giovampaola d' Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time that dressed a Valentino.
When it was an adolescent and he lived in Italy, he dreamt of coming to have the age and the occasion to be able to use one of his evening dress...
Finally the hour to ends of the years arrived 90.
I bought my first dress of Valentino to use in a festival in the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard of Ligne.
Was a red suit, with skirt of high, "corsage" draped and honor word neckline.
"It was a dream done reality", the widow says of Rodrigo d' Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent fashionable, its obsession is the timeless thing", explains this Italian aristocrat that lives among Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D' Arenberg guard its dresses of festival of the couturier with "the cared for maximums... because a dress is not only a dress, is also the assembly of memories that involves".
The "king" of the fashion
The great end of the exposition of Somerset House is the bridal gown of Marie-Chantal Miller in its wedding with Pablo of Greece in 1995.
Four months of work they were needed and 25 "ragazze" (as calls the couturier to its seamstresses) to devise that suit of ivory-colored silk with inlays of pearls, twelve types of different lace and a queue of four meters and medium.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, maximum authority of the press specialized, that dress represents a milestone of the high fashion of ends of the 20th century, "the return of the clientas of the high company".
It confused during years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is its better copy.
Cavaliere I gave Great Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere of the Lavoro, Commandeur of L' Ordre give Arts or give Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of its clientas.
"Always the attention has called me its refinement, its calm, its perfect and immaculate aspect", recognizes D' Arenberg.
The last time that I saw was it a month ago in a formal dinner in the Museum of Offside.
He was on the table of the countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great my friend.
"It was impeccable, the time does not pass for him".
If it says her a princess...
The hardest position of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euro, the porteadores of the Indonesian volcano are played the life and the health charging 70 kilograms of sulfur through steep paths of stone
There is people for the one that its work is a hell and another that, literally, works in the hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners that earn a living removing sulfur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For it, has to descend each day to the fund of its crater, where the sulphurous gas that emanates of the bowels of the Land solidifies upon entering contact with the air.
After starting large rocks of sulfur, that on the whole come some 70 kilograms weigh, leads to them in two baskets of bamboo that charges on its shoulders through steep paths of stone.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, that is elevated to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porteadores delay more than 40 minutes in elevating at a snail's pace, keeping the equilibrium and measuring with tact its steps for be not slipped and to fall for the precipice.
They know that any stumble would be able to cost them the life, as a French tourist occurred that was thrown down years ago by the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen win 5 hundredth of euro by each kilogram of sulfur that extract
Once up, they are opened step among the tourists that photograph them as if were monkeys of circus and, charging wearisome the heavy baskets, three kilometers to the scale walk that a mining company has situated a little further down, to 1,850 meters of height.
It is a matter of PT Candy Ngrimbi, a business that exploits since 1960 the volcano and, never better said, to its workers, to the ones that pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 hundredth of euro) by each kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 hundredth of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in the everyday life and is used to manufacture matches, fireworks, cosmetic, dynamite and even for whiten the sugar.
"As the normal thing is to charge 70 kilograms, we remove some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euro) in each trip", explains us Anto, who is used to performing three daily postage.
It delays three hours in each one and finishes shattered, but they permit him to join 138,000 rupees (11.5 euro) in the end of the day.
Although a misery for so inhuman effort seems, is the triple of what would win in the country.
"The daily wage of the miners is very high here, where the harvesting of the coffee is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euro) the day and the monthly medium salary is of two million rupees (167 euro)", clarifies the porteador, that before worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali.
There, its salary was of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euro) to the day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with its family to Banyuwangi, a town close to the volcano, by a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, turns out to be so forceful as the sulfur: "I married a youth of Bali, where they are hinduistas, and I have brought it to Java so that be converted to the Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and they are irritated him the eyes by the poison gases
To its 27 years, Anto carries three being played the hide in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur already has begun to pass him bill despite be covered the face with a mask and special eyeglasses.
It has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and they are irritated him the eyes by the poison gases that says good-bye the volcano.
It is the price that should pay to obtain its dream.
"I will work two years more because I want to open a store or to study Spaniard or French", promises in an Englishman more than acceptable.
It punished by the life, this nice and intelligent youth could be tourist guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead of that does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy cabin of wood with other porteadores, each day raises itself at two o'clock of the early morning because the sulfur not to stops flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color is returned blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto low to the crater being lit with a small flashlight adhered to his helmet, that himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 porteadores charge the baskets of sulfur on its shoulders since the fund of the crater
In spite of its abundant benefits, the mining company has mechanized the extraction of the sulfur to save prices neither supplies no equipment to the porteadores, that work for its account and to so much the weight.
In fact, not even they see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) of surcharge by camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euro), the guards of this nature reserve charge the tourists that respond to photograph the volcano and to their human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people", protest Madrusin, a strong one porteador of 42 years that carries in the Kawah Ijen three decades, since left the school.
Capable to raise to 110 kilograms, assures that will endure working "everything that be able" because needs the money to educate its three children, from among 18 and 10 years.
Me I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and escuece the eyes when the wind changes of unforeseen and traps the miners in the thick columns that leave the volcano, they are so hard that none complains to suffer serious illnesses... beyond, clear is, of their habitual respiratory problems, artrosis, pains in the knees and sores in the shoulders, that have themselves malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on its back, Unainik already only can charge 50 kilograms to its 53 years.
Each day, he and its companions start 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, that three trucks transfer to the store of Tamansari, 18 kilometers of distance by a road of goats among the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life", proclamation Unainik opening well the mouth, where various teeth they lack him.
Of its five children, the major, of 30 years, also works charging sulfur.
The time passes, but the misery perpetuates of generation in generation one of the hardest positions of the world: the one that do the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
The singapurenses blame to the career, the stress and the cost of the properties and the education by have not children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, ¡we comply with ours to owe civic and we believe life!
Can seem improbable that these verses be part of a mint tablets announcement, but in spite of that - or perhaps due to that - the video returned viral in YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that utilizes local references as "we Are going to put a beam (bun) in the oven" for reírse of the birth rate of Singapore.
The business of publicity that did the video, BBH, harbors the hope that with the announcement they manage to call attention to the in a way amusing problem.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, he says that he wanted to use the power of the music so that the people comply with "its national duty".
This is something purely of internet, so we had to do it amusing and funny.
Is the major problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world in reproducing us ourselves, so we feel that this was a theme that had to undertake.
We knew that the government had tried many things, as to launch perfumes with pheromones or to organize evenings of fast appointments (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but did not necessarily they function.
We so we think, ¿why do not do it more creative possible to solve this problem, that is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one that itself it is not taken so on the spur of the moment is the government of Singapore.
It spends US$1.300 to the year in politics to encourage the citizens to have more children.
A package of the government for marriages and parents offers to 15,000 dollars by boy, extends the maternity leaves and distributes fiscal benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city-state and of highly technology in the southeast of Asia, also known by the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national division of population, is situated at present in 1.2 children by woman.
The last time that was above 2 -known as rate of reinstatement- was in 1976.
So ¿why the singapurenses do not have more children?
So Wei Ming, Marriage Politics director and Family of the National Division of Population, he says that due to a "better education" and "a more extensive range of opportunities of career".
"That has permitted to the people to have a more extensive range of options in life objectives terms and priorities, beyond being married and to form a family", explains.
These changes in the social norms have contributed to the increase of the celibacy, and to delay the marriage and the births, what gives as a result a decrease of the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, a tip eu immigration politics to enlarge drastically the immigration to face the decrease of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the xenofobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, to the ones that they criticize for maintaining the low salaries and not to be integrated.
The increase of the immigration is also seen as one of the reasons by the ones that last year the party of government of Singapore experienced its worse electoral result since the independence.
Since the elections there has been an intent to correct the problem, with the quotas and higher obligations for the foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects in the economic growth of a nation, the fiscal incomes, the sanitary prices and the politics of immigration, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government tries that themselves not so many small houses be built.
For example, has begun to affect to the real estate sector.
The authority of urban development has passed to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoebox", that can be built in you determined zones of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and they have had a lot of success of sales.
Nevertheless, there is worry that they can promote a way of life of celibacy and they discourage to the desarrolladores that quieran to build you marry large, family.
But Lim Yew Soon, general director of the business real estate agency THE Developers, he says that their "shoeboxes" are sold a lot more fast than the largest units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than the units of greater size.
This does that be a lot better for our cash flow.
Nevertheless, it admits that the new norms give clearer orientation for the desarrolladores, to the ones that before was put them bonds if wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much they stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Though these new rules can be a step toward the increase of the national birth rate, upon speaking with the singapurenses that work in the financial district of the center to seem that they are not going to have a lot of effect.
"The people is very stressed, the houses are faces and also the education is him, for which many people are postponing him", an executive youth says.
Other people can have children.
"But for me is important to include my own money and time", another youth of some 20 years says.
Men and women mention its career, the stress and the cost of the properties and of the education as the motives that impede them to have children.
So, however much the government try to push their citizens to have children, when is a matter of doing babies, the singapurenses are who they have the last word.
The private thing off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Real Spanish Academy is a matter of the quality of private or "the environment of the private life that has the right to protect of any insertion".
What is private for a less than 16 years?
How applies this definition in its everyday life and in the social networks?
He understands the dangers to the ones that is exposed by airing on the Internet situations that surely would not share off-line?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys from among ten and 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term to "something very mine", in the personal plan, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deeper secrets would not rise them to a post", says Jorge, of ten years, when tries to explain the meaning of private in places as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where has accounts since two years ago.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom he can know them, but not everyone", he affirms.
In FB I rise pretty images or of play.
Also I entertain me with my acquaintances.
"It would not share a photo that do not be mine, or of someone that is doing the ridiculous one", says.
The boy recognizes that he is ill to publish obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know the 35 friends that has in FB and to its nine followers in Twitter.
The majority are kin.
The mother is included, he has the key of one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express me and to write tweets interesting.
"Do not I know if they answer me, I alone rise them", adds.
"The social networks are entertained, I can speak with distant kin or with my friends in a fast way", indicates.
Does not it doubt in answering that never would accept a request of an unknown person.
Neither attention to someone would pay him that a strange one recommended him.
The case of José, of 14 years, is different.
The adolescent possesses open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this last one he admits not to know to 20 of the aggregate people in his list of friends.
"Does not it frighten me, because we have something in common, the music for example", indicates.
According to the boy, none has been insinuated him neither the direction of its house has asked him or its phone number.
"If they pressured me or me it to require simply the bag of my account", recognizes.
José follower was done of Ask, after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
To the boy not alien the experiences are him of what today he is known like ciberbullying.
To an acquaintance of a my friend they were extorting it in a social network.
They threatened it and they required him money.
"Never who knew was", he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"Alone privacy put him".
Then it explains a series in transit to configure the account in a sure way.
As opposed to Jorge, this boy would rise photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes it would do him, if falls me badly or I carry him desires.
"Although I know that that is ciberbullying", affirms.
You ask key
Marielos Sticks, teacher of English and licentiate in Education and Learning, considers that to orient the children and to the adolescents should be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to report.
"Internet arose like a middle to seek information, but with the aparecimiento of these places they changed the rules of the play", mentions.
Sticks indicates that the academic one Marc Prensky, master in Teaching by the University of Yale and author of the Native work and Digital Immigrants, minted these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young that were born with the technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that have to teach them to them, when still we are learning", he says.
It comments that the theme is complex, "because we are asking them that they have a definite criterion on what agrees or not to diffuse, to publish or to tell an age that the maturity does not give for that".
"Also that be selective when what more imports is them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", adds.
According to the specialist, the most efficient way to teach what is privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that cause they reflect them.
"To tell them that it do not does not serve", adds.
Subsequently, Sticks enumerates some options: There are things that him you would not count to a strange one, ¿why do it on the Internet?
Or, ¿you would like that they publish a photo of you as the one that published of a friend?
You know what the other they publish on you?
When festivals photos labels, ¿you asked permission to the other people for labeled them?
And one more, ¿all they need to know it what you are doing each moment?
Another point is to cause to see that they should act on line as they do it off line.
They are the same rules.
"One out of Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, equal should be in the social networks", affirms.
Caution
Estuardo Guard, university professor, professor of grade school and educational consultant, comments that turns out to be indispensable that the parents of family read conscientiously the politics of the social networks.
Upon understanding each one of the clauses they have solid bases to converse with their children on the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is permitted to share or to publish", says.
According to Guard, key results to recall the children the lesson of "do not speak with strange".
It finalizes Summit of the Unasur without make public the Statement of File
I SAW it presidential Summit of the south american Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without was make public the Statement of File, announced previously and theoretically subscribed by the seven assistant proxies.
Efe tried in repeated opportunities to agree to the document signed in it I SAW Ordinary Meeting of Heads of state and of Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellery and of Presidency they indicated in a start that were going to deliver it after the closure, but later they affirmed that in some moment will be published in the web of the Peruvian Government.
Upon being consulted by the text, they indicated that the content had been exposed for the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during some brief statements to the press.
The access of the journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted in every moment.
During the alone day was transmitted, in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted".
The little information that to circulate among the reporters was delivered by the spokesmen of press of some of the governments of the Unasur assistant to the appointment, although not the Peruvian.
The only document divulged during the day was the list of assistant presidents, what caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists of diverse national and international media that asked greater data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but is a matter of the pronouncement of Humala, and not of the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the III Summit Arabian South America-Countries (REEL), and on that occasion, despite to be required insistently by the press, neither the also called Statement of File was diffused that previously they had announced.
In the official web of REEL can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities endeavored in which there were systems of insured broadcast for all the journalists but they limited to the maximum the obtaining of information.
The summit concluded also with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure of the Cut of It Have that resolve a frontier disagreement among both countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, they met during the regional appointment and they ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), that begins Monday at The Hague to listen the summing-ups of both parts, in the process that File presented against Santiago.
"We will obey and we will execute the sentence that defines the differences that nowadays are carrying to this international cut", he said Humala, next to his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and is going to continue being a respectful country of the international law, of the peaceful solution of the controversies, of the treaties and of the international courts", added Piñera, and greeted with a squeeze of hands to Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will be submitted to the CIJ occurred as soon as Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by the one that had accepted to be submitted to the failures of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was carried out with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Moral; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended of Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate of the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was the responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit, shortly after the noon of File.
The proxy read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the courses of action for 31 projects among the South American countries by a total of 17 thousand million dollars in investments were set.
Among the agreements adopted mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will give "important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the agreements on residence".
It reported that actions are prompted to improve "the cooperation in the fight against the civic insecurity and against the transnational crime organized, actions for do more accessible the medicines, the Internet access to low price in all the corners of South America, and to attend in a joint way and efficient the risks of natural disasters".
With an Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant headquarters but should serve to expand nustra productive headquarters and to glimpse a better future for our towns", added Humala.
"We have determined to privilege a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural zones and of borders. ..uniendo to our countries and generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president in a read message said.
Among those projects, mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and they are located in the cross axes of its territory, since the coast toward Brazil, and two aim at a greater connection with Equator, although did not give greater details.
Likewise, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We expect that the electoral process in that country serve for its return to the Union of South American Nations", of which is found at present excluded.
The need that Latin America be maintained like a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations among neighbors, was another of the matters underlined by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Holy, he said before initiating its participation in the regional appointment that expected to be met with its pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in respectful form the maritime disagreement after a failure of the CIJ, questioned by Bogota.
"The day of tomorrow (Saturday) is possible that have an encounter with the president Daniel Ortega", said Holy.
"We are going to revise all these roads, they are not exclusive, inclusive the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua", underlined.
"With the president Ortega I expect to be able to tell him that we handle this of the possible respectful and most civilized form", added Saints.
Holy and Ortega they would be found on Saturday in Mexico where they anticipate to attend takes it of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Rock Grandson.
Likewise, like part of the summit, the ministers of Defense of the block met previously to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, that seeks to fortify the dialogue and the consensus in matter of Defense in the region.

"South America should learn of Europe to integrate a citizenship" : Rafael Strap
The president of Equator, Rafael Strap, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, should learn of Europe".
Strap, that participated in it I SAW presidential Summit of the Union of south american Nations (Unasur), celebrated in File, declared to the state TV Peru that the Europeans "were killed in World War Two" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
It defended, in that sense, the project to establish the south american citizenship that encourage the member countries of the Unasur.
"One must obtain the free mobility of citizens and workers by any south american country, as already occurs with the members of the Andean Community, but still there are reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", notified.
The Ecuadorian president was shown, besides, in favor of the recomposición of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise to lower the influence of the Anglo-saxon states and to keep in mind to the ones that they have signed the pact of San José on the human rights.
The ones that give professorship never they compromise to nothing and, on the other hand, we the south american sign it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Pan-american Commission of Human Rights be in Washington under the financing U.S.", affirmed in allusion to the political asylum given by Equator to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Strap assured that is not repented of that decision because with it has not betraied its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic values and of human rights".
It added that, in its moment, "there was suspect founded that Assange to be extradited to a third country and itself not its process was respected".
It criticized, besides, to the swedish justice by requiring him that be submitted in its territory to the interrogation by a presumed sexual crime when "the own swedish legislation permits to carry out by means of videoconference, that would be able to do since the embassy of Equator in London".
Strap affirmed that the risk exists that deteriorate the mental and physical health of Assange.
"I have not spoken with him since is in our embassy, but the ambassador reported me that he had a small pulmonary problem, serious nothing", the Ecuadorian proxy said.
What yes there is is the danger that deteriorate its mental and physical health by being locked in a small space without being able to do exercises outdoors.
"That complicates the health of any person", added.
Strap indicated that the solution to the asylum offered to Assange from June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by means of the concession of a salvaconducto that permit to travel to Equator, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and underlined that there has been conversations with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word do not we utilize it in this case, but there has been permanent conversations.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and of the European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Waiter, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances", mentioned.
And it thought that "if Great Britain gives tomorrow the safe-conduct this is finished".
And if Sweden, as perfectly its legislation permits it and as has done in other cases, interrogates the Mister Assange in the embassy of Equator in London or interrogates it way Skype same tomorrow is finished this problem.
Strap took advantage of to be reaffirmed as a defender of the freedom of the press and qualified that what does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie, that devaluate the freedom of speech".
"The greater enemies of the freedom of the press we are not the evil and evil politicians but the bad journalists in function of the gain, the blackmail and the extortion", he said.
In that aspect was congratulated that no longer be these journalists "neither the bankers neither the countries hegemónicos and middle-class the ones that dominate to Equator", and advanced that of to be reelected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the road and the correct direction".
Strap also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least to its next elections, upon arguing that the agency "should be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and the coup covered with legality" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president considered, besides, "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Holy, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits among both countries after the failure of the International Cut of Justice of It he Have, that benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the moment itself not that failure obeys.
Is a problem between a South American country and one central american.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they should be surpassed for the together will to walk.
One must process them of extensive form to surpass them and to continue ahead.
Likewise it trusted in a good conclusion of the lawsuit by maritime limits that maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and thought that "is correct for Latin America to seek international authorities if the two countries compromise to accept failure however hard may be".
In reference to the eventuality that itself present as the candidate in the next presidential elections in Equator to seek a third consecutive mandate indicated that sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and happiness, although at times is quite hard".
Strap assured that if loses the assemblies of February of the 2013 will withdraw of the public life.
In it personnel has never interested me the power, but in situations as unjust as that of Equator that alone socioeconomic poverty can be corrected since the political power.
"My movement pólitico believed that was I who guaranteed that probable victory, therefore we have to accept that reponsabilidad", he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and from there we leave the public life.
If we lose equal.
"It is a decision", affirmed.
Strap referred also to the new processing of health of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I have just spoken with the Venezuelan vice president Nicolas Mature and he tells me that travelled to a processing that already was planned, of routine, that was expected that even the campaign to return to Cuba.
"Does not it signify a relapse in the state of health of the president Chávez", commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in File in it I SAW Summit of heads of state and Government of the Union of south american Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls to a greater regional integration to maintain the progress, the equality and the security.
Deaths by been today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old of age when they confirmed him the result of the test: Positive AIDS.
"It was as if me to fall a bomb", refers upon recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor tried to do "smoother", without evident success.
The boy hid him his family.
It decided to be take charge alone of its illness and began to be reported on her; with such pledge that already celebrated its birthday 43.
Is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the Unit of HIV of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of the human immunodeficiency (HIV) since 22 years ago, somewhat difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90, when there were many doubts, few options of processing and more stigma.
Then, to the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided to be said good-bye of him "because brought a cut one".
Then, to have been was synonym of death.
Now it is possible to survive to this syndrome and to do it with quality of life.
Nevertheless, ignorant of their illness, still many people arrive when the virus already has caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
To 31 years of the apparition of the been in the world, at least of the first cases reported, "the great achievement signifies at this time that the sobrevida of a patient that initiates processing in opportune form and the sobrevida of the general population, is exactly equal", indicated the leader of the Unit of HIV of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was vouched for in April of this year In a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectólogo and expert in HIV/BEEN, Andrade Villanueva commented that since the year 2008, the scientists had concluded that the been was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life depend on the degree of affectation to the immune system that present the patients upon initiating the diagnosis, with better expectation for who are not users of drugs: of to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 And of 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous thing signifies that who receives the diagnosis of positive HIV at the age of 25 of age, under these terms "while be maintained in control will be able to live without problems to the 75 years", explained the interviewed.
To measure this advance, one should recall that the hope of life of the Mexicans today is of 76 years on the average.
Though the mortality has descended significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people that die of been descended of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), is also certain that since the apparition of the been, 60 percent of the patients in the national database they have deceased.
Only in Straw hat 255 people passed away in 2011, and go 187 deaths until May of this year; nevertheless is assured that there is universal access to the medicines antirretrovirales since 2005.
- ¿Why does there continue being deaths?
- Seems me me TO that the problem is not of access to processing.
Thus I visualize it, thus has happened us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had shortage of medicine the problem is that the patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is to say, in late phases of the illness.
It gave a forceful data: "Nine of each ten patients arrive when already they present some opportunistic infection what has to be done to have a greater impact on the global mortality, is to do earlier diagnoses and, therefore, tests of detection have to be offered in a massive way, to all the people that require it".
In its proposal specialists they coincide and officials of the State Counsel of Prevention of the Aids in Straw hat (Coesida), also the own patients, like Fabrizio, who responded to be done the test to a private laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite its short age, already was in phase of been and even suffered sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
All changes when you know that have been.
Some they think that they are going to die and they do not want to know anything.
"If already I am going to die, better I burst three times to the week", they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, me food well, I do exercise, volume the medicines.
To the date, its parents only know that suffered cancer.
I live a normal life, as any.
"Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have a sexual active, but jointly responsible life, me I care for me and to the other person", enumerated Fabrizio, who accepted to share their intimacy with PLASTERED MILLENNIUM to motivate with their testimony to whom today, in the framework of the World Day of the Aids, they are afraid.
That they be done the test, if they had risk, that among quicker they know if they are positive HIV, is better and if already they have the diagnosis, that learn that they can live like any person, being heads.
That, its message, summarizes the motto of battle upon being this 2012.
Condoms after the counter
Large they are the holes that there is among the programs of health and the common citizen, maintained Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara who has assumed the cause around the HIV.
And the largest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "really the distribution of condoms has been increased, before they gave us of one or two, now packages give us from to a hundred, and that is very well but it so happens that there is who today, still, they do not have access to a condom", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections they are the adolescents.
"¿Why do you want them?" is asks common, with sarcasm and value judgments of social workers, school guidance counselors, employees of pharmacies and personnel of health, to which itself not the adolescents want to be exposed, assured the communicator.
It proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that the condoms be not only after the counters and those a hundred be found in quick of public baths of the places that frecuentan the youths.
It is not to motivate the promiscuity.
Neither it is a matter of paying them the cellos and the motel, as responded the governing one Emilio González, upon asking him if there would be I distribute of condoms in his Administration.
"Thus it is not the sexuality, the best is to approach the condoms to whom already they practice a sexual activity", aimed.
Keys In Straw hat
There are 13.435 cases accumulated (12.158 of been and 1.317 of HIV).
The state is 4° national place in new cases and accumulated of been and 13° of HIV.
92% of the contagions corresponds to the sexual way, 6% to the blood way and 2% to the perinatal way.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV since by a registered case there is from 4 to 5 people that it do not know.
It ratified by a court of appeals U.S. a sentence that does not know restructures it of the debt of the way achieved Vitro Group a commercial contest in Mexico, the setting places a harmful precedent for any national business with ramifications in the neighboring country that have problems of reliability.
It would be told, therefore, that the procedures in guarantee of survival of the firms that permit the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, the wrong way of international covenants.
In the practical land, the recognition to the sentence emitted June 15 passed through the judge Harlin Haul of the cut of Bankruptcies for the north district of Texas, leaves defenseless to the Mexican firms set against the possibility of embargo of its properties in allende the Brave one.
Nevertheless, the resolution opens the door to the main glass-maker in Mexico to respond to the Supreme Court of the United States, alleging three weaknesses.
Of entrance, while the judge of the cause indicates that the creditors should be governed for the Law of Bankruptcies of the United States, the court of appeals of the Fifth Circuit, with headquarters in New Orleans, he says that the main procedure is the commercial contest dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would imply to know not the international legal cooperation in businesses insolvency cases with transnational profile.
In fact, toward that end the Model Law of United Nations for the Uniformity of the International Commercial Right was created, being placed as the referee the American one Law Institute.
In second place, the sentence establishes that without the vote intercompañías, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial contest the debts that had with its headquarters the subsidiaries of Vitro, itself not to have been achieved the majority required to approve restructures it.
Nevertheless, the possibility the Mexican laws they recognize it.
In fact, that of Vitro has not been the first case in which the plan is accepted.
There they are half a dozen of examples, among them Agremex and Commercial Mexican, whose debts intercompañías vouched for the Federal Institute of Commercial Contests.
The certain thing, besides, is that reducing the votes of the subsidiaries, at any rate the creditors of Vitro that fought against this in Parliament U.S., that is to say the funds "vulture" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, they will not have achieved majority.
The voting would have been of 45 percent against 37.
The data omits it the Court of appeals.
Since another angle, this blames to Vitro of the difficult situation that faced from the 2008 to dodge of the serious economic crisis that faced United States, hitting him the swayings to the country.
By the quick thing, the firm of the family González Sada will interpose a resource of reconsideration before the own court of appeals so that the voting arrive at the full one of this, that is to say the five judges, given that only they voted three.
Of prosper not this will be demanded the resource of I Affirmed that requires the review of the process on the part of an upper instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious thing of the case is that the court put sideways a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Cut"), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of Commercial Contests is detailed, indicating that this was relieved with I attach to the covenants signed by both countries to draw this with the chapter 15 of the Law of Bankruptcies of the United States.
More still, it is indicated that the country fold to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for the international trade, that is to say the rules set for cross-border cases of insolvency, that they guarantee equity for debtors and deserving.
Billiards of two bands: they hit to Vitro and they hit to the country.

Hector "Hetin" Kings: "The basketball has been my life"
Globetrotter of the basketball Hector "Hetin" Kings was more than 60 years connected with the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to him, he travelled the entire world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental harvesting of the history of the local basketball as extensive as has it Hector "Hetin" Kings.
And the fact is that before a cerebral discharge confined it to a wheelchair in the 2008, Kings was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, were as the player of smaller categories, player of the authorized, National Upper Basketball and leader in the BSN with the Cattlemen of Bayamón or president of the Confederacy of Basketball.
"I put me many hats in the basketball through my life, including various to the same time, as when was a president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and president from the federation during the years 90", recalled Kings during a visit of First Hour to its home in Bayamón, where resides with Isabel, its faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball has been my life".
Kings does not exaggerate upon doing that assertion.
The walls of their house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias that denote their extensive path, thus they testify it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, the ones that hoards with greater emotion are the ones that recall their step by the Cattlemen from the middle of the decade of the 50 as the player until 1982, when complied 15 years functioning like coapoderado or attorney of the franchise.
"Those were my better years, the ones that more I enjoyed me because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships of the Cattlemen since 1967, already were as the attorney, coapoderado or leading.
They were many years of satisfactions, including the five championships run since 1971 until 1975.
And then I said good-bye with one in the 1981, the year of début of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
From there on it took charge "Sly" Ortiz, that was a great administrator", he indicated Kings.
I remember that Gene Bartow, that had directed here and was in the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have you a well strong player, of 6"7" of stature.
You want it?"
And that was the principle of Mincy, one of the better players than has had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, that was nativizado and was one of our better marksmen.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had given a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help to bring another more.
The championship of the Cattlemen with Gausse was enjoyed it, but already to the distance, therefore for 1988 already figured of kingpin from the federation.
For that time preferred to enjoy its achievements and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we win for the first time to United States during the Preolímpico in Mexico of 1989.
Then it came the World one of 1990, where we arrive room place and must have been bronze of be not for that Canadian referee that caused repeated us the final move for the second time, said Kings.
That group of the World one of 1990 is the best National Team that have seen?
It is among the better, the same as the one that won to the Dream Team in the Olympics of 2004.
But my favorite one was that of the pan-american in Cuba in 1991, when we win gold and we gave a peels to the team U.S., that was quite similar to which the bronze in the world one won us.
That not alone team repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Review, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but had also to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young, to the brothers Lion (Francisco and Edgar) and to Mario "Quijote" Moral, that had not been able to be in the 90 due to a wound in the knee.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but a medal of gold gave us and a great happiness was that of the Preolímpico of the 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players of role as "Canito" Snows, Pablo Alicea and a youthful one Mentioning Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the mess of the pan-american one of Sea of the Silver, we win gold against all the forecasts.
Which has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers to level of international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated to that level as he did him Piculín.
And that without counting its path in the different leagues that played.
Who has been the best leader boricua?
That is very difficult.
We have had a very good gang that includes July Bull, Flower Meléndez, Carlos Moral, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Towers.

They initiate course that explores the "End of the world"
Each week, the students explore apocalyptic themes as the nuclear war, the zombies, the virus and germs, and the global warming-up.
This semester, when the professor in religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, knew that included an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, to which many people have been grasped like a proof that comes itself the end of the world.
But Charmé did not have idea of what expected him in the following pair of months: The cataclísmico hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some they have called "deudarmagedón" and a growing conflict that involves to Israel, the place where the Christian theoreticians of the end of the times believe that will be initiated the Apocalypse.
"Did not I realized that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester than has had", said Charmé this week to the students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If one it analyzes what has been happening in the world nowadays as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And they recall that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not only professor that offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last one of the history.
In Temper, the assistant professor Barry Vacker is giving the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world".
Each week, the students explore apocalyptic themes as the nuclear war, the zombies, the virus and germs, and the global warming-up.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate with the time", he said, and the way in which they offer hypothetical settings that guide certain human conduct.
If the nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, would be able to explode a war.
This month the students analyzed movies with apocalyptic themes and they explored how they are compared with examples of the real life.
"They tried to inform the students on what is possible, probable, credible and impossible", said Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and its colleague Loved Solari, an enclosed teacher of art history and Anthropology, they have done team to give a course, titled only "The end of the world".
"Do not we add '2012' to count always with the option to give the course again, in the event that the world be not finished ", said Restall.
Despite the "imminent ruin", the students should study, to generate projects and to take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, what does not leave the students another option more than working "to the same night in which is supposed that the world finishes", said Restall.
The courses turned out to be quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours", said Restall on its course for students with highly average, that was filled with 35 students.
We receive messages by e-mail during weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, of people that asked if still there was place.
The students, in turn, they assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It turns out to be fascinating me to see what do the people to be consoled to itself", he said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the career in Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the fact is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality, is only question of consolation or of the absence of the same one.
Will Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Nursing, of 25 years, he said to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"Never he had listened on a class that could teach that", he indicated.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a professor - said to believe in the expiration date of December 21.
"Our first project treated on the Mayan prophecy and of certain way we discredit him", he said Julie Zeglen, student of last year in Temper, of 21 years and of West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; is so alone a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But it mentioned that an apocalyptic anxiety in the western culture exists, that goes back to various centuries, in which the people reacts to the changes around him predicting the end of the world.
Internet has caused a boom of these speculations.
"In other sides the people does not think about this", said.
In especially in the world of English speech.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University The Salle that gives courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of if knew on some course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, insinuating an exception of an upper authority.
We have an exemption of the Pope.
Restall caused noted that along the years has been spoken of many judgment day, and said that if does not pass anything December 21, "the people will begin to think immediately in the next date" or to filosofar that December 21 is the start of a period from seven years at the end of which the world will be finished.
Students and professors are being taken on the spur of the moment the date.
Various they said that they think to go to festivals "of the end of the world".
"Perhaps it call some friends so that we laugh together", commented Samira Ford, student of communications of 20 years.
